# PHASE 3: MOBILE APP DEVELOPMENT PLAN

**Project:** Subhesco/EBDESIGN Agricultural Digital Operating System  
**Phase:** 3 - Mobile Application Development  
**Timeline:** 3-6 months  
**Status:** Planning Phase  
**Created:** 31 August 2026

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for developing native mobile applications for the Subhesco/EBDESIGN platform. The mobile apps will extend the platform's reach to farmers and consumers on-the-go, providing real-time access to marketplace, financial services, and AI advisory features.

## PROJECT OBJECTIVES

### Primary Objectives
1. **Farmer Mobility App**: Enable farmers to manage their operations from anywhere
2. **Consumer Marketplace App**: Provide consumers with easy access to agricultural products
3. **Real-time Synchronization**: Ensure seamless data sync between mobile and web platforms
4. **Offline Capability**: Support core functionality in low-connectivity areas
5. **AI Advisory Integration**: Bring AI-powered farming advice to mobile devices

### Success Metrics
- 10,000+ downloads within 6 months
- 95% uptime reliability
- 80% user retention rate
- 4.5+ app store rating
- Sub-3 second response time

## TECHNICAL APPROACH

### Cross-Platform Framework Selection

**Recommended Framework: React Native with Capacitor**

**Rationale:**
- Leverages existing React frontend components
- Single codebase for iOS and Android
- Access to native device features
- Familiar development stack
- Strong community support

**Alternative Considered: Flutter**
- Pros: Better performance, native-like UI
- Cons: Different language (Dart), steeper learning curve
