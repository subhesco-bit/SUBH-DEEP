## Conclusion

The Subhesco/EBDESIGN system is currently **15% production-ready** with **5 critical blockers** preventing production deployment. The most significant gaps are in database execution, AI integration, testing, and monitoring.

**Critical Path to Production:**
1. Execute database migrations (2-3 weeks)
2. Implement AI model integration (6-8 weeks)
3. Build monitoring infrastructure (4-6 weeks)
4. Implement security features (8-10 weeks)
5. Build testing infrastructure (12-16 weeks)

**Total Estimated Time:** 32-43 weeks (8-11 months) for production readiness

**Recommendation:** Focus on critical blockers first. Do not attempt production deployment until all P0 blockers are resolved and minimum production readiness criteria are met.
