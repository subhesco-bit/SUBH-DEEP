/**
 * Regional demand forecasting.
 *
 * Replaces a 25-line stub that returned `{ forecasts: [], note: 'stub' }` on a
 * live, unauthenticated route. A stub behind a mounted endpoint is worse than
 * a missing endpoint: the caller gets a 200 and an empty array, and reads that
 * as "no demand" rather than "not built".
 *
 * Reads `demand_forecasts` (015 owns the table; 052 added the scalar regional
 * columns) and `mandi_prices` (056).
 *
 * NOTE ON THE TWO CONFIDENCE COLUMNS
 * 015 carries `accuracy` — measured AFTER the fact against what happened.
 * 052 carries `confidence` — CLAIMED at forecast time. They are different
 * quantities and averaging them produces a number that means nothing, so this
 * service reports them separately.
