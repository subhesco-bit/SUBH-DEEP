/**
 * ADVANCE RATE PRICING — forward curves, downside risk, commitment advice.
 *
 * Recovered from afrera_platform_v44.html, where it existed only as browser
 * JavaScript with its coefficients hard-coded. Verified absent from this
 * backend before porting: none of yieldIndex, priceImpact, forwardCurve,
 * basis, valueFloorParticipation or commitAdvice appeared anywhere in
 * backend/src.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR
 *
 * A farmer with an unharvested crop is asked to commit some of it forward at a
 * floor price. How much is sensible? That depends on weather-driven yield
 * risk, price volatility over the horizon, whether the crop physically
 * survives to the delivery month, and how badly the farmer needs cash now.
 * This module answers that, with a band rather than a single number, and
 * refuses to answer when the model has no business speaking.
 *
 * THREE PROPERTIES CARRIED OVER DELIBERATELY
 *
 * 1. NEVER A SINGLE NUMBER. Every forward price is central/low/high with a
 *    stated confidence band. A point estimate on an unharvested crop invites
 *    a farmer to treat a guess as a promise.
 *
 * 2. SHELF LIFE IS A HARD CONSTRAINT, NOT A WEIGHT. v44 records that an
 *    earlier version treated perishability as one factor among four and
 *    advised holding 34% of a two-week lemon over a one-month horizon — i.e.
 *    advising a farmer to keep something that would be compost. Holding
 *    capacity is now capped by shelf life first; the other factors allocate
 *    only within whatever room is left.
 *
 * 3. IT DECLINES. Below 0.5 confidence the answer is "NO RECOMMENDATION" with
 *    a reason and a list of what would help. A forward commitment is a real
 *    obligation against a harvest that does not exist yet; being confidently
 *    wrong costs someone their season.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED IN THE PORT
 *
 * Coefficients now come from `arp_crop_parameters` rather than a const literal,
 * so they can be calibrated, audited, and carry provenance. Confidence comes
 * from `arp_district_calibration`, which derives it from how much local data
 * actually exists rather than accepting a number from the caller.
