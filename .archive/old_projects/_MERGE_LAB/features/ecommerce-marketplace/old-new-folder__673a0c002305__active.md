# ACTIVE TASKS

## DONE — Resolved the 4 deferred Tier-1 schema/product decisions from 30 Aug (2026-08-31)

User asked to validate the 4 deferred items from the 30 Aug batch and take decisions rather
than leave them open indefinitely. Validated each against the actual code (not the stale
framing) before deciding:

1. **`crop_plantings` model / `farms` table** — confirmed real: `digitalTwinService.js`'s
   farm+crop paths, `advancedAnalyticsService.js`, and `predictiveIntelligenceService.js` each
   invent a DIFFERENT imagined shape for "a farmer's planted crop," none matching each other or
   the real `crops` catalog (041: `crop_code`/`common_name`/`category`/`duration_days` only).
   **Decision:** built `farms` + `crop_plantings`
   (`9999_zzzz..._farms_crop_plantings_schema.sql`) sized to `digitalTwinService.js`'s actual
   usage, and rewired its 4 methods (`verifyFarm`, `getFarmRealTimeData`, `verifyCrop`,
   `getCropRealTimeData`) against them — verified via `node --check` + `require()` + full boot.
   **Deliberately not extended** to `advancedAnalyticsService.js`/`predictiveIntelligenceService.js`
   in the same pass: their crop queries are entangled with a second, unresolved question (a
   `harvests` table that doesn't exist, and `order_items.crop_id` where the real column is
   `product_id`) that would mean guessing at how orders relate to crops vs products — recorded
   as still-deferred in `schema-decisions.json`, not silently fixed wrong.
2. **`farms` table / digital twin duplicate service — found something bigger than the original
   framing.** While validating this, found `services/legacy/digitalTwinService.js` was a second,
   fully independent, live-mounted digital twin implementation — required directly in
   `index.js`, initialized at boot, self-registering routes at the SAME `/api/v1/digital-twin`
   prefix the real service uses. It was written against a `digital_twins` shape
   (`farm_id`/`configuration`/`is_active`) that has never existed in any migration (the one real
   table, from 072, uses `entity_type`/`entity_id`/`owner_id`/`current_state`) — broken since
   the day it was written, not a regression. Most of its routes were silently shadowed by the
   real router (mounted first); the non-colliding ones (bare `POST`/`GET /api/v1/digital-twin`,
   `PUT /:twinId`, `POST /:twinId/sensor-data`, `GET /:twinId/simulations`) were reachable and
   500ing on every call. **Decision:** un-mounted it (removed the `require`/`initialize()`/
   `setupRoutes()` calls from `index.js`), left the source file on disk rather than deleting it
   (its simulation-model functions may be worth porting into the real service later). Verified:
   fresh boot clean, no `ReferenceError`, all other routes unaffected.
3. **`iot_devices` ownership model conflict** — validated `digitalTwinService.js` really does
   query a nonexistent `iot_devices.entity_id`. **Decision:** route through `farmer_id` instead
   of adding a new, would-be-unused `entity_id`/`entity_type` pair — every `digital_twins` row
   already has `owner_id` (the twin's farmer), so `getRealWorldData()` now passes
   `twin.owner_id` into `getIoTDataForEntity()`, which queries `iot_devices WHERE farmer_id = $1`
   (a column that already exists and is already populated by
   `iotIntegrationService.registerDevice()`). No migration needed. Rejected the generic
   `entity_id` alternative because nothing would ever populate it — would have been a second
   unused column, the same fabrication-adjacent smell already flagged elsewhere in this repo.
4. **`iot_sensor_data` vs `sensor_data`** — re-validated rather than re-guessed: confirmed
   `services/legacy/iotIntegrationService.js` (the one actually built against 031's `sensor_data`,
   INTEGER FK) is mounted separately and without collision at `/api/v1/iot-integration`, distinct
   from the real `/api/v1/iot` (which uses `iot_sensor_data`, string device_id). Not a dead
   duplicate like item 2 — two genuinely coexisting, differently-scoped systems. **Decision:
   stays deferred**, correctly — forcing a merge here would mean picking a device-linking
   strategy blind, exactly what this file's own rules warn against.

All 4 recorded in `backend/src/database/schema-decisions.json` with `resolution_2026_08_31`
(or `_partial`) fields. Verified via `node --check`, `require()` smoke tests, and 2 full fresh
backend boots (both reach the expected `EADDRINUSE` against the already-running dev instance —
proof every route including the changed ones mounts without throwing). Not committed yet.

## DONE — Devin's 31 Aug 2026 "Strategic Services" batch: verified, integrated, 2 harmless schema collisions flagged

User asked to "integrate all devin work with claude ai work." Found an uncommitted batch on
this branch (`audit/ui-api-fix`): 4 new backend services + route files under
`backend/src/services/strategic/` and `backend/src/routes/strategic/` (pre-season purchase,
contract farming, household procurement, government subsidy — a "multi-role ecosystem" per
`.ai/architecture/MODULE_STRATEGY_FRAMEWORK.md`), a 619-line migration
(`strategic_services_schema.sql`, 19 tables), 4 new frontend pages, and edits to
`backend/src/index.js`, `frontend/src/services/api.js`, `frontend/src/config/routes.js`,
`frontend/src/components/ui/enhancedComponents.jsx`, `frontend/src/index.css`.

The untracked `.ai/architecture/CRITICAL_INTEGRATION_TESTING_REPORT.md` and
`CRITICAL_TESTING_CORRECTION_REWRITE_REPORT.md` (self-labeled "Audit-Ready, Litigation-Ready")
already claimed this same batch was wired and corrected. Per this project's own
`.ai/handoffs/DEVIN_WORK_PROTOCOL.md` ("no fake completion... verify by running the code, not
by reading it"), did not trust those claims — re-verified independently:

- `node --check` on all 8 new service/route files: clean.
- `node -e "require(...)"` on all 4 new route files individually: all resolve clean (correct
  `authMiddleware`/`requireRole` shim from `../../middleware/auth`, correct
  `apiResponseHandler.sendSuccess`/`sendError` usage — both lessons from the 30 Aug batch,
  applied correctly here).
- Full backend boot (`node src/index.js`): reaches `EADDRINUSE` (an already-running dev
  instance), meaning every route file including the 4 new ones mounted without throwing.
  Confirmed `/api/v1/strategic/{pre-season,contract-farming,household,government}` are
  actually mounted in `index.js` (not just claimed).
- `npx vite build` in `frontend/`: 0 errors, all 4 new pages bundle.
- Traced every SQL query in the 4 new services against `strategic_services_schema.sql`'s
  actual column names by hand (per protocol step 8) — no live DB in this dev environment to
  test against directly.
- `frontend/src/components/ui/enhancedComponents.jsx`'s 1-line diff and `index.css`'s
  `@import`-before-`@tailwind` reorder are both genuine bug fixes, not cosmetic: the former
  removed a duplicate JSX `animate` prop (second one was silently shadowing the first,
  breaking the pulse/non-pulse branch); the latter fixed a CSS spec violation (`@import` must
  precede other rules) that some build tooling silently ignores and others don't.

**Real bug found and recorded (not present in either untracked report above), harmless
currently:** `strategic_services_schema.sql` declares `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS buyers` and
`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS laboratories`, both of which already exist from earlier migrations
(041, 033) that run first — so the strategic file's own versions silently no-op, same failure
class as the earlier `roles` collision (see `schema-decisions.json`). Checked whether this
actually breaks anything by tracing every query: it doesn't, yet — the strategic services only
ever read/write columns the winning tables already have. Recorded as `deferred` in
`backend/src/database/schema-decisions.json` rather than merged blind, since the extra columns
(`credit_rating`, `nabl_accredited`, etc.) aren't used by any current caller — fixing this now
would be speculative schema work with nothing to verify it against.

**Not independently re-verified (inherited from the untracked reports, but consistent with
what this session's own checks show):** the `/api/v1/ai` → `unifiedAIRoutes` /
`/api/v1/ai-legacy` → `aiService` split, and the 6 Tier-1 routes' `/api/v1/` prefix
standardization — both already present in the current `index.js` diff and both boot clean,
so no reason to distrust them, but no live-database or live-request test was run against
either (no Postgres/Redis in this dev environment, consistent with every prior session).

Nothing committed — working tree left as-is per this session's git rules (commit only on
explicit request).

## TODO — Devin's 30 Aug 2026 Tier 1 batch: integrated, blockers fixed, schema gaps remain (resume here, target 5pm 31 Aug)

Devin landed a large uncommitted batch on 30 Aug 2026: 6 new "Tier 1" backend services
(M025-M030 - advanced analytics, predictive intelligence, IoT integration, blockchain
verification, digital twin, enterprise integration), 9 new frontend pages, an API response
handler, and a UI/UX enhancement pass (~208 files). Self-reported as "production-level" /
"COMPLETE" in `.ai/enhancements/PRODUCTION_COMPLETION_REPORT.md` etc. — per this project's
established pattern, that claim did not hold up under verification. Ran a bug audit and a DB
audit (`.claude/audits/AUDIT_BUGS.md`, `.claude/audits/AUDIT_DB.md`) against the full batch
before integrating. Result: 0 of the 6 services could complete a single request or DB query
as committed. Fixed everything mechanical; left everything that needed a product/schema
decision **explicitly flagged**, not guessed.

### Fixed this pass (boot/build blockers + mechanical bugs) — ✅ DONE
- `frontend/src/config/routes.js` — malformed orphaned object literal (leftover from a
  botched dedup of `CorporateBuyerPage`, which already has a real route at line 722) was a
  JS syntax error that failed the **entire frontend build**, not just the 6 new dashboards.
  Deleted the dead fragment.
- `backend/src/middleware/apiResponseHandler.js` — only exported `success`/`error`, but all
  9 touched route files (6 new + `farmerRoutes.js`/`cropManagementRoutes.js`/
  `marketplaceEnhancements.js`, a regression against previously-working code) called
  `sendSuccess`/`sendError`, which didn't exist — every request 500'd. Added matching aliases.
- All 6 new route files imported `{ authenticate, authorize }` from
  `'../middleware/authMiddleware'` — **that file does not exist anywhere in this repo** (the
  real module is `../middleware/auth`, exporting `authMiddleware`/`requireRole`). This meant
  none of the 6 route files could even `require()` successfully — missed by the bug audit
  (which only ran up to the response-handler bug), caught by an actual `require()` smoke test
  before commit. Fixed via a shim import in each file:
  `const { authMiddleware: authenticate, requireRole } = require('../middleware/auth'); const authorize = (roles) => requireRole(...roles);`
- `frontend/src/components/ui/common.jsx` — `DataTable`'s `column.render` was silently
  renamed to `column.cell`, breaking custom cell rendering on 21 pre-existing pages with no
  error (tables just rendered raw values). Now supports both (`column.cell || column.render`).
- `backend/src/services/blockchainVerificationService.js` — was reading/writing the wrong
  table (`blockchain_transactions`, which already exists under a totally different
  Ethereum-style schema from `019_blockchain_traceability_schema.sql`) and the wrong `products`
  columns (`product_name`/`farmer_id`/`status` vs real `name`/`created_by`/`is_active`).
  Repointed at a new `product_custody_transactions` table and fixed the `products` query.
- `backend/src/database/migrations/072_tier1_m025_m030_schema.sql` (new) — added the 7
  genuinely-missing tables (`analytics_data`, `iot_sensor_data`, `digital_twins`,
  `twin_simulations`, `enterprise_integrations`, `integration_sync_logs`, `payment_records`,
  `product_custody_transactions`) plus the `iot_devices` ALTERs (`farmer_id`,
  `specifications`, `registered_at`, `last_active`) that `iotIntegrationService.js` hardcodes
  in raw SQL. Column shapes verified against what the service code actually queries, not
  against Devin's speculative sketch in the completion report.
- `advancedAnalyticsService.js` — fixed a `CROSS JOIN`-without-a-join-condition Cartesian
  product in `getPlatformAnalytics` (rewrote as independent scalar subqueries), and SQL
  injection via string-interpolated `timeRange`/filter values (added `toSafeInterval()`
  whitelist + a column whitelist for `buildCustomQuery`/`buildWhereClause`, now parameterized).
- `predictiveIntelligenceService.js` — same `timeRange`/`days` injection pattern fixed
  (clamped/whitelisted). `getEnvironmentalConditions()` returns hardcoded fake weather
  (25°C/70%/120mm for every farm regardless of real location) fed into every yield
  prediction — did **not** fabricate a fix (no weather API is configured), instead made it
  honest: returns `configured: false`, and `predictCropYield()` now surfaces
  `environmentalDataConfigured: false` and caps confidence at 0.4 instead of the previous flat
  0.75 that implied a real model.
- `digitalTwinService.js` — `storeTwinState()` was discarding every twin-sync state update
  (only bumped `last_synced`, never persisted `state`); `getLatestTwinState()` hardcoded
  `'farm'` for every twin including crop twins, silently corrupting simulation input. Added a
  `current_state JSONB` column (in 072) and fixed both methods to actually use it, reading
  `entity_type` from the row instead of hardcoding.
- `iotIntegrationService.js` — 2 small logic bugs: `processDataBuffer()` logged the buffer
  size *after* clearing it (always logged 0); `checkThresholds()` treated a threshold of `0`
  as falsy and silently skipped it.
- `IoTMonitoringDashboard.jsx` / `DigitalTwinPage.jsx` — were calling the backend with the
  literal string `"current"` instead of the signed-in farmer's real ID
  (`/api/iot/farmers/current/devices`), which would either 500 on a typed FK column or
  silently return zero rows. Wired both to `useAuthStore()`, matching the pattern already used
  elsewhere in this codebase (see `DashboardPage.jsx`).
- Verified: `npx vite build` succeeds clean; all 9 touched route files `require()` without
  throwing; backend boots to the point of listening (got as far as `EADDRINUSE` against an
  already-running dev instance — confirms route mounting itself no longer crashes).

### Deferred — needs a product/architecture decision, NOT guessed (pick this up tomorrow)
Recorded in `backend/src/database/schema-decisions.json` (4 new `deferred` entries) and
`.claude/audits/AUDIT_DB.md`:
1. **`crop_plantings`/`crop_cycles` model doesn't exist.** `advancedAnalyticsService.js` and
   `predictiveIntelligenceService.js` were written against an imagined per-farmer
   planted-crop-instance schema (yield tracking, growth stage, harvest date) that was never
   built — the real `crops` table (041) is a static catalog. Every analytics/prediction query
   in both services will still fail until this is designed. Not a one-line ALTER.
2. **`farms` table doesn't exist at all.** `digitalTwinService.js`'s farm-twin path
   (`verifyFarm`, `getFarmRealTimeData`) is 100% broken until either a real `farms` table is
   added or the service is pointed at whichever existing table (`farm_plots`?
   `farm_information`?) was actually intended — needs a human decision, not a guess.
3. **`iot_devices` ownership model conflict.** `iotIntegrationService.js` links devices to a
   farmer via `farmer_id`; `digitalTwinService.getIoTDataForEntity()` expects a generic
   `entity_id` link to any twin-able entity. Two same-day Devin services disagree on this
   table's shape — didn't add a bare `entity_id` (ambiguous without an `entity_type`
   companion) to paper over it.
4. **`iot_sensor_data` (new, 072) vs `sensor_data` (031, pre-existing).** Same real-world
   concept, incompatible device-linking strategy (business string ID vs INTEGER surrogate FK)
   and incompatible `quality` semantics (enum vs 0-100 score). Kept as two tables; reconcile
   once IoT ingestion is actually live.

None of these four block the app from booting or building — they block specific
DB-touching methods within the 6 new Tier 1 services from succeeding against a live database.
Everything else in the batch is now wired, honest about what's fake vs real, and building
clean.

## TODO — "make all gaps zero" (2026-08-29, in progress, resume here)

User asked to close every code-achievable gap from the AFRERA Gap Index
(https://claude.ai/code/artifact/88f6d4d1-6e22-4c45-be8f-62fa28a96cbd) to
zero. Confirmed scope with user: everything buildable through real code;
explicitly NOT faking external integrations (PM-Kisan/DigiLocker/bank APIs)
or fabricating ML models (genetic algorithms/RL/GNNs from the "imagination"
doc) — those need real credentials/infra this session doesn't have and
would violate the whole session's "never fabricate" discipline.

### 1. Wire the 6 genuinely-orphaned backend services — ✅ DONE
Built 6 route files (`cropPlanningRoutes.js`, `landRecordsRoutes.js`,
`insurancePremiumRoutes.js`, `insurancePolicyIssuanceRoutes.js`,
`insuranceFraudDetectionRoutes.js`, `productReviewRoutes.js`), mounted all 6
in `index.js` at `/api/v1/crop-planning`, `/land-records`,
`/insurance-premium`, `/insurance-policies`, `/insurance-fraud`,
`/product-reviews`. Also fixed a real honesty bug found while wiring
`landRecordsService.js`: `fetchGovernmentLandRecords()` silently returned
`[]` disguised as "simulate the sync," so `syncWithGovernmentLandRecords()`
would report a fake "0 synced" success forever instead of being honest that
no real government API is configured — fixed to return an explicit
`{configured: false, reason}` shape, matching the not_configured pattern
used elsewhere in this codebase. Verified: fresh backend boot clean, all 6
routes smoke-tested live (200/401 as expected; the 2 that hit real
`ECONNREFUSED` did so inside real table-querying service code, not a
routing bug — confirmed via log inspection).

<details><summary>Original in-progress notes (superseded)</summary>
All 6 are real, substantial, already-written service classes with zero
route file and zero index.js wiring. Method signatures already gathered
(see below) — next step is writing one route file per service (direct
service calls, no controller layer needed, matching the platformCoreRoutes.js
style established this session) + mounting in index.js + boot-verify +
smoke-test each live.

- **cropPlanningService.js** (533 lines) — `createCropPlan(farmerId, planData)`,
  `getFarmerCropPlans(farmerId, filters)`, `getRecommendedCropPlan(farmerId, landRecordId)`,
  `getSuitableCrops(soilType, state, district, season)`, `getMarketDemand(season)`,
  `getWeatherForecast(district, season)`, `updateCropPlanStatus(planId, farmerId, status, updateData)`,
  `getCropPlanningAnalytics(farmerId)`. Depends on `crop_plans` table (FK to `land_records`)
  — verify migration exists before wiring.
- **insuranceFraudDetectionService.js** (593 lines) — `analyzeClaimForFraud(claimId)`,
  `getFraudAnalysis(claimId)` (plus 8 internal check* methods, not directly routed).
- **insurancePolicyIssuanceService.js** (526 lines) — `issuePolicy(policyData)`,
  `getPolicy(policyId, userId, isAdmin)`, `getPolicyByNumber(policyNumber)`,
  `getUserPolicies(userId, filters)`, `renewPolicy(policyId, renewalData, userId, isAdmin)`,
  `cancelPolicy(policyId, userId, reason)`, `processPayment(policyId, installmentNumber, paymentData)`,
  `getPolicyDocuments(policyId)`, `uploadPolicyDocument(policyId, documentData)`.
- **insurancePremiumService.js** (416 lines) — `calculateCropPremium(cropData)`,
  `calculateTransitPremium(transitData)`, `calculateWarehousePremium(warehouseData)`,
  `calculateLivestockPremium(livestockData)`, `generateQuote(quoteData)`, `getQuote(quoteId)`.
- **landRecordsService.js** (468 lines) — `addLandRecord(farmerId, landData)`,
  `getFarmerLandRecords(farmerId, filters)`, `getLandRecord(recordId, farmerId, isAdmin)`,
  `updateLandRecord(recordId, farmerId, updateData)`, `verifyLandRecord(recordId, adminId, verificationData)`,
  `syncWithGovernmentLandRecords(farmerId)` (calls `fetchGovernmentLandRecords` — check this is
  an honest not_configured stub, not a fabricated government call), `updateFarmerFDIForLand(farmerId)`,
  `getRegionalLandStatistics(filters)`, `deleteLandRecord(recordId, farmerId)`.
- **productReviewService.js** (450 lines) — `createReview(userId, productId, reviewData)`,
  `getProductReviews(productId, filters)`, `getProductReviewStats(productId)`,
  `markReviewHelpful(reviewId, userId)`, `updateReview(reviewId, userId, updateData)`,
  `deleteReview(reviewId, userId, isAdmin)`, `moderateReview(reviewId, status, moderatorId)`,
  `getUserReviews(userId, page, limit)`, `reportReview(reviewId, userId, reason)`.
</details>

### 2. The 7 "Domain: TBD" modules — ✅ DONE (turned out not to be skeletons at all)
Surprise finding: all 7 (`M013` Authorization/446 lines, `M055` Pricing/303,
`M056` Payment Processing/95, `M057` Shipping/78, `M058` Returns/74, `M060`
Review Management/87, `M144` Greenhouse/568) already have real, substantial
service.js content — their READMEs were just never updated after the real
code was written, still claiming "Auto-generated module template. Domain:
TBD." All 7 are already live via the generic
`/api/v1/backend-modules/:moduleId/:operation` bridge (confirmed:
`generatedModuleRoot` auto-discovery in index.js) - no wiring needed.

Fixed while verifying:
- **M060 real bug**: `getProductContext()` returned a hardcoded fake
  `{category:'grains', average_rating:4.2}` for every product regardless of
  ID, fed straight into an "AI sentiment analysis" call as fabricated
  context. Now queries real `products`/`categories` tables.
- **M144 three real bugs**: `fetchGreenhouseSensorData()` returned one
  hardcoded fake reading for every device (no real IoT gateway configured -
  now honestly reports `configured:false`); `getGreenhouseAIInsights()` had
  a hardcoded `confidence:0.89` on what's actually deterministic rule-based
  math (removed); `evaluateTrigger()` unconditionally returned `true`, so
  every automation rule fired on every check regardless of its actual
  condition (now evaluates real field/operator/value thresholds).
- **Known duplication flagged, not yet merged**: `M060` (Review Management,
  writes to its own `reviews` table) duplicates
  `services/legacy/productReviewService.js` (writes to `product_reviews`,
  wired this session at `/api/v1/product-reviews`) - two independent real
  review systems. Documented in both READMEs; reconciling them is separate
  follow-up work, not done in this pass.

All 7 READMEs rewritten to reflect real content. Verified: both M060 and
M144 load clean after the fixes.

### 3. Build the 2 genuinely-absent modules — ✅ DONE (also not actually absent)
Re-verified per this session's own "verify by checking, not by trusting
labels" rule, established while fixing the earlier 7 "Domain: TBD" modules.
Both M005 and M132 turned out to already be real, complete, and fully wired
end-to-end — README claims of "Status: ABSENT / scaffolding" were false, same
bug as items 2 above. Confirmed: `M005/index.js` and `M132/index.js` both
export `{controller, service, router}` (the shape `backendModuleBridge.js`'s
generic scanner needs), both real frontends already call them
(`EnvironmentManagementPage.jsx` via generic `moduleId="M005"` panel;
`PondManagementPage.jsx` via `pondAPI` in `api.js`, hitting
`/api/v1/backend-modules/M132/*`). Fixed both READMEs.

Found and fixed 4 real fabrication bugs in M132 while verifying (identical
pattern to the M144 fixes above): `fetchSensorData()` returned one hardcoded
fake reading (`ph:7.2, temperature:28.5,...`) for every device — now honest
`{readings:[], configured:false, reason}` since no real IoT hub exists;
`analyzeTrends()` returned a hardcoded `{STABLE, INCREASING, STABLE}` for
every single reading even though a trend needs 2+ points — now
`'insufficient_data'`; `getPondAIInsights` and its sub-predictions carried
hardcoded `confidence: 0.87/0.85/0.82` on deterministic arithmetic — replaced
with `method: 'rule_based_calculation'`; constructor claimed
`this.iotHubConnected = true` unconditionally — fixed to `false`. M005 had
no bugs — its static lookup tables are legitimate fixed config, not
fabricated data. Verified: both `node -c` clean, backend boots clean with
both loaded.

### 4. BR-08 unwrapped transactions — NOT STARTED
20 (directive) to 46 (docs/registry) multi-statement writes with no
transaction wrapper. Helper already exists (`core/withTransaction.js`).
Needs finding the actual call sites (directive PART 8.3 categorizes them:
money 4, identity 4, sync 4, lifecycle 7, other 1) and wrapping each —
explicitly NOT a blanket auto-fix, each needs judgment per the directive's
own standing rule.

### 5. 6 ERP domains with no proactive AI agent — ✅ DONE
Added 6 real, honest, rule-based agents to `core/erpAgents.js`'s AGENTS array,
matching the existing pattern exactly (evaluate(ctx), return null when there
is nothing to say, confidence:1 where the output is arithmetic on real
inputs rather than a prediction): `controlling.cost_variance` (AF-CO, budget
vs actual with a 10%-materiality gate), `assets.lifecycle` (AF-AA, fully
depreciated-but-active assets + idle-asset detection), `logistics.delay_risk`
(AF-TM, ETA vs delivery commitment), `production.oee` (AF-PP, Overall
Equipment Effectiveness with weakest-factor callout), `hr.leave_liability`
(AF-HCM, leave balances over policy cap — encashment liability + burnout
signal), `masterdata.quality` (AF-MDM, missing required fields + unresolved
duplicates). Verified: `node -c` syntax-clean, and a direct script confirms
all 19 DOMAIN codes now have >=1 agent (21 agents total, up from 15).

### 7. FOLU / NE organic-scheme tracking exposed to frontend — ✅ DONE
Investigated per explicit user request ("folu, organic scheme in ne and its
tracking... north east has organic scheme for which tracking is also
required"). Backend was already real and complete:
`organicTraceabilityService.js`'s `organicSchemeStatus(farmerId)` queries
real `ne_organic_enrolment`/`ne_organic_schemes` tables and computes
conversion-period progress honestly (with a human-readable note on how much
of the conversion period remains). Already exposed via `foluRoutes.js` at
`GET /api/v1/folu/schemes/:farmerId`, and — corrected an earlier wrong
finding in this same session — already wired into `frontend/src/services/api.js`
as `foluAPI.schemeStatus()` (an earlier grep for the literal string
"organicScheme" missed it because the client method is named
`schemeStatus`). The actual, narrower gap: `LandUseCarbonPage.jsx` never
called it, so there was no UI to see it. Added an "NE organic scheme status"
section to that page — farmer-ID lookup form + a table of scheme
enrolments (scheme name, certification body, years into conversion,
conversion-complete flag, subsidy rate, and the honest note). Verified:
`npx vite build` clean.

### 8. PWA + responsive audit — PWA already real; fixed 2 real mobile-overflow bugs
User asked for production-level mobile/desktop/tablet compatibility; asked to
choose PWA-first vs native wrappers vs finishing the gap list first — chose
"Responsive PWA first." Investigated first rather than assuming nothing
existed: the PWA layer was ALREADY real and complete from earlier in this
session — `public/manifest.webmanifest` (icons, shortcuts, standalone
display), `public/sw.js` (real cache-first/network-first strategy, correctly
never caches writes or auth), registered in both `index.html` and `App.jsx`,
plus a real `Layout.jsx` app shell with `BottomNav`/`Sidebar` and Tailwind
responsive classes. Nothing to build there.

The real gap: `DataPrimitives.jsx` (the shared scaffold ~50+ pages built this
session import — `ModulePage`, `DataTable`, `Section`, `Field`) had 2 mobile
bugs. `DataTable` rendered a bare `<table style={{width:'100%'}}>` with no
overflow wrapper — on a narrow phone this pushes the whole page body
sideways instead of scrolling internally; fixed by wrapping it in
`<div style={{overflowX:'auto'}}>`. `ModulePage` used a fixed `24px` side
padding, disproportionate on a 320px viewport; changed to
`clamp(12px, 4vw, 24px)`. Also added `flexWrap:'wrap'` to
`LandUseCarbonPage.jsx`'s two filter-row forms (a pattern several pages
built this session repeat inline — worth checking others if this becomes a
priority, not swept in this pass). Both fixes are centralized in the shared
component, so every page built on `DataPrimitives.jsx` inherits them without
being touched individually. Verified: `npx vite build` clean.

Not done (explicitly out of scope for this pass, flagged for later): a
systematic audit of all 150 frontend pages for viewport/breakpoint issues —
most of the original 123 Devin-built pages already use Tailwind's
mobile-first utility classes directly rather than `DataPrimitives.jsx`, so
this fix doesn't reach them; a full page-by-page pass is real, bounded work
but large enough to warrant its own scoped session rather than folding into
this one.

### 9. "Replace all generic to professional" sweep — 12 modules, DONE
User: "replace all generic to professional enhanced to highest industry
standard meeting our project requirement", then "you decide for all gap
filling in best interest of project." Interpreted as: find every remaining
module still carrying literal generic scaffold boilerplate ("Auto-generated
module template. Domain: TBD" / "Status: ABSENT") and fix it properly, not
just relabel it.

Found 12 via `grep -rl "Domain: TBD\|Status: ABSENT"` (the earlier 9 fixed
this session false-matched on their own explanatory prose quoting the old
text — not real remaining generics). All 12 (M001, M003, M004, M076-M080,
M122, M123, M127, M141) turned out to have real, substantial service.js
content (54-568 lines each) despite the false "ABSENT" label — same pattern
as the earlier 7+2. Rewrote all 12 READMEs with accurate status + an honest
real-vs-placeholder breakdown.

Found the fabrication problem is systemic in the Water domain (M076-M080,
~2200 lines) and mirrored (without confidence fabrication) in Livestock
(M122/M123/M127): dozens of helper functions return the same hardcoded
numbers regardless of input, dressed up as computed metrics. Confirmed this
is LIVE and user-facing, not theoretical - `frontend/src/pages/
WaterManagementPage.jsx` calls all 5 Water modules directly through every
tab. Given the scale (~80+ functions, many chained), a full rewrite was
judged disproportionate risk/effort for one pass. Instead: added a clear
`DATA-SOURCE DISCLOSURE` banner comment to the top of each service.js
naming exactly which functions are real vs static placeholder, and fixed
the single most misleading pattern specifically - every hardcoded
`confidence:`/`confidence_level:` field (7 fixed across M077/M078/M080),
which falsely implies statistical/ML rigor. M122/M123/M127 had no local
confidence fabrication to fix. Also fixed M003's `getBandwidthUsage`/
`getResourceUtilization` (hardcoded per-tenant "usage metrics" ignoring the
tenant ID entirely). Verified: all 12 `node -c` clean.

Discovered in passing, not yet reconciled: M123 (Poultry) and M127 (Animal
Health) may duplicate separate legacy services - `PoultryManagementPage.jsx`
and `AnimalHealthPage.jsx` call `poultryAPI`/`animalHealthAPI`, not these
M0XX modules. Worth a dedicated reconciliation pass, same shape as the
M060/productReviewService duplication found earlier this session.

### 10. NE Variety Directory + AI image-gen pipeline — mostly already done, closed the one real gap
User attached `North East India Variety Directory.docx` (a real,
citation-backed 142-variety NE India commercial/agronomic database) asking
to add it to vendor/consumer with AI-generated images "to test our next-gen
AI image tool." Investigated before building: this was ALREADY fully built
earlier in this session - `regional_variety_directory` schema + seed
migration (142 rows, verbatim from this exact document), `regionalVarietyService.js`,
`routes/regionalVarietyRoutes.js` (mounted at `/api/v1/variety-directory`),
and `frontend/src/pages/VarietyDirectoryPage.jsx` (browse/search + a real
"create listing from this variety" vendor flow requiring a real
seller-entered price). The image-generation pipeline itself
(`productMediaAIService.js`) is also already real and honest: a real
provider-adapter pattern keyed off `OPENAI_API_KEY`/`STABILITY_API_KEY`,
returns `not_configured` (not a fake image) since neither key is set here.

The one real gap: the frontend page never called the already-wired
`requestImage` endpoint anywhere. Added a "Generate reference image (AI)"
button per variety card that calls it and honestly renders whatever comes
back (`completed` + image, or `not_configured` with the missing env var
named, or `failed`). This is the correct way to "test" the tool right now -
it will honestly report not_configured until a real API key is added, then
work with zero code changes. Verified: `npx vite build` clean.

### 11. AI dietitian/naturopath layer — found already 80% built, wired the missing 20%
User: "ai based Dietitian cum Natural Therapist (Naturopath) layer is
completely missing." Checked before assuming: `nutritionIntelligenceService.js`
(1165 lines, real) already has nutrition scoring, personalized product
recommendations by dietary profile, diet-based recipe generation, and
wellness practices - genuinely most of what an AI dietitian/naturopath
layer needs. It even already defines and exports its own Express `router`
with 16 real routes. The actual gap: zero mounting in `index.js`, ever -
fixed with one `app.use()` line. Verified: backend boots clean with it
mounted (only pre-existing, unrelated infra noise - no Postgres/Redis
running locally, a port-in-use conflict from a prior test boot).

**Correction, same pass:** the frontend WAS already built too -
`frontend/src/pages/DietRecipesPage.jsx` (135 lines) already calls the
exact `nutritionAPI` object in `services/api.js`, which already targets
`/nutrition-intelligence/*` (dietary profiles, recommendations, diet-based
recipes, wellness practices) - already registered in the router at
`/diet-recipes` with "dietitian" in its own SEO keywords. So the entire
feature - backend service, route mounting, API client, frontend page, router
registration - is now complete end-to-end; the ONLY real gap was the single
missing `app.use()` line, now fixed. Not a partial win - closed.

Checked separately: `NutrientValueMarketplace.jsx` is confirmed a genuinely
different, already-wired feature (value-per-nutrient pricing, not diet/health
advice) - no gap there either. No dedicated AI chatbot specific to nutrition
was found or built; the existing floating `ChatInterface`/`VoiceAssistant`
widgets (mounted globally in `Layout.jsx`) are the platform's general
conversational AI surface, not nutrition-specific.

### 12. Systematic "zero route wiring" sweep + duplicate-route correction
User: "correct all zero route wiring, orphaned routes so that all hidden
comes out", then "mount all route files", then "duplicate route search and
correcctions". Generalized the manual orphan-finding done earlier into a
real scan: every `services/legacy/*.js` filename cross-referenced against
all text in `routes/`, `core/`, `controllers/`, `modules/`, and `index.js`.

**Found and fixed real gaps:**
- `nutritionIntelligenceService.js` mounted (see item 11).
- 6 route files under `routes/legacy/` (apiculture, fisheries, forestry,
  mushroom, sericulture, vermicompost — M028/M025/M026/M029/M027/M030) were
  never mounted. Root cause: all 6 imported `{ authenticate }` from
  `../../middleware/authMiddleware`, a module that **does not exist**
  (the real file is `middleware/auth.js`) — mounting them as-written would
  have crashed the boot at require-time. That's the actual reason they sat
  unwired, not incompleteness. Fixed the import in all 6 (aliased to the
  real `authMiddleware` export), verified each backing service
  (`apicultureService.js` etc.) exports the exact method names the routes
  call, mounted all 6 at `/api/v1/{apiculture,fisheries,forestry,mushroom,
  sericulture,vermicompost}`. Verified: full backend boot clean, only
  pre-existing unrelated infra noise (no local Postgres/Redis).

**False positives caught before acting on them (both corrected same pass):**
- `custodyEventService.js` looked orphaned by the scan (only checked
  `routes/`), but was already wired via a `setupRoutes(app)` pattern in
  `services/legacy/custodyEventRoutes.js` — a different mounting convention
  the scan didn't check. Built a redundant `routes/custodyEventRoutes.js`
  before catching this; deleted it once found.
- `resourceCrudFactory.js` and `unifiedConfigService.js` are a factory
  function and a compatibility shim respectively, not meant to be routed
  directly — correctly unreferenced by name in route files, not gaps.

**Real duplicate-route correction (not just orphan-finding):** searching
`index.js` for `app.use()` calls on the same path twice surfaced
`/api/v1/insurance` mounted from both `insuranceEnhancements.js`
(pre-existing) and, it turned out, from the 3 "orphaned" insurance route
files this session itself added earlier (item 1 above) —
`insurancePremiumRoutes.js`/`insurancePolicyIssuanceRoutes.js`/
`insuranceFraudDetectionRoutes.js` mounted at `/insurance-premium`,
`/insurance-policies`, `/insurance-fraud`. **Correction to item 1's record
above: those 3 were NOT genuinely orphaned** — `insuranceEnhancements.js`
already called the exact same 3 underlying services
(`insurancePremiumService`/`insurancePolicyIssuanceService`/
`insuranceFraudDetectionService`) under `/api/v1/insurance`, and
`frontend/src/services/api.js` already calls that path, not the new one —
confirmed via grep before deleting anything. Compared route-by-route: the
only real gap in `insuranceEnhancements.js` was
`PATCH /quotes/:quoteId/status` (admin quote-status update), ported it over;
deleted the 3 redundant route files and their `index.js` wiring entirely.
Net effect: item 1's actual orphaned-and-now-fixed count is 3 (crop
planning, land records, product review), not 6 — the insurance functionality
was already live the whole time, just re-discovered under a
misleadingly-named routes file. Verified: boot clean after removal.

**Correction (same day, later check):** the "devinService.js has zero route
wiring" claim above was WRONG - a bug in the orphan-scan script (root
`services/*.js` files were checked against the wrong text-source list).
Direct grep confirmed it WAS fully wired: `index.js` → `routes/devinRoutes.js`
→ `controllers/devinController.js` → `services/devinService.js`, mounted at
`/api/v1/devin`, live the whole time. User explicitly asked to remove the
Devin integration entirely once this was found ("stop devin services",
"devin layer was remove"). Deleted all 3 files
(`devinService.js`/`devinController.js`/`devinRoutes.js`) and the
`index.js` mount; confirmed nothing else referenced any of them first.
Verified: boot clean, zero dangling references.

### 13. NE Harvest visual redesign + marketplace seeding (2026-08-30)
User compared the live app unfavourably against afrera_platform_v42/v43/v44.html
(static design references, ~13k lines each, same design system across all
three: paddy/forest/turmeric/chilli/indigo palette, Bricolage Grotesque +
Public Sans + IBM Plex Mono typography). Scoped explicitly to "public pages
first" per AskUserQuestion.

**Made one real mistake, caught and fixed same pass**: used `Write` on
`pages/FarmerEntranceHubPage.jsx` without reading it first - it already
existed, fully built (real 4-door public entrance system, better than what
was written). Overwrite caught via `git status` immediately, restored from
git, redundant new file + duplicate routes.js entries removed. Root cause:
assumed a documented UX gap was unbuilt without checking; the actual gap was
just that HomePage.jsx's CTA never linked to the already-built hub - fixed
that one real line.

**Delivered**: added the real design tokens as scoped `v42-*` CSS custom
properties (`index.css`) + Tailwind theme extension (`tailwind.config.js`),
so they don't collide with the ~140 other pages' existing token system.
Restyled `Header.jsx` (all real dropdown links/logic untouched, className
only) and all 13 public routes (`HomePage`, `MarketplacePage`,
`ProductDetailPage`, `LoginPage`, `RegisterPage`,
`FarmerEntranceHubPage` + its 4 door pages, `ForwardPricingPage`,
`ClimateWeatherPage`, `CorridorEconomicsPage`, `LandUseCarbonPage`).
Verified `npx vite build` clean (3220 modules) after every batch.

**AI image generation**: found `productMediaAIService.js`'s general
per-product image pipeline (`requestProductImageGeneration`) was fully built
and even routed (`productMediaAIRoutes.js`, mounted at
`/api/v1/product-media-ai`) but had zero frontend caller. Added
`productsAPI.requestImage()` and a real "Generate reference image (AI)"
button on Marketplace product cards with no photo - same honest
not_configured pattern as the Variety Directory's existing one.

**Marketplace seeding**: confirmed via `grep` across every migration - zero
seeded products anywhere, ever. User's explicit decision (asked via
AskUserQuestion, given this touches the "never fabricate a price" rule):
seed real products from the 142-variety regional_variety_directory with
clearly-labelled indicative directory-estimate pricing (matching v42's own
"Product prices are indicative directory estimates" disclaimer). Wrote
`9999_zzzzz_products_from_regional_variety_seed.sql` - maps the directory's
21 granular categories onto the 12 real seeded product categories, flat
per-category-tier indicative pricing (not researched per product), excludes
Animal Product/Fisheries (no honest category fit), tags every row
`indicative-pricing`, sets no `created_by` (no fake seller), links back via
`variety_directory_id`. **NOT executed or verified against a live database**
- no Postgres running in this dev environment, consistent with every other
migration this whole session. Needs a real DB run + spot-check before
trusting the exact row count/mapping.
Root `modules/` tree vs `backend/src/modules/M0XX/` — no doc declares which
is canonical. This session empirically resolved the practical question (real
logic lives in `backend/service.js`, delegates to `backend/src/services/legacy/`)
but that finding only lives in this session's log — write it up as a short,
permanent doc (e.g. `.ai/architecture/MODULE_SCAFFOLD_RECONCILIATION.md`) so
it doesn't need re-deriving next time.



**Project:** SVESCO/EBDESIGN Agricultural Digital Operating System
**Last Updated:** 28 August 2026
**Status:** In Progress — rewritten to reflect verified current state, not the
2026-08-24 Devin-handoff snapshot below. Everything under "Closed" was
checked by actually running the code (backend boot + frontend build), not
inferred from reading it.

## Closed this session (2026-08-29, later still): AI orchestration consolidation, part 2

Recovered the 2026-08-28 stakeholder briefing artifact and checked its "Still
open" table against everything done since. Confirmed: the "5 independent AI
orchestration systems — architecture debt" item was only half-closed by the
earlier aiOrchestrator.js/aiOrchestratorCore.js merge. Found the other 2:
`core/claudeAICoordinator.js` (a separate, real, live Claude SDK coordinator
— constructs an actual `@anthropic-ai/sdk` client — reachable via two
duplicate route files, `routes/unifiedAIRoutes.js` and
`routes/claude/unifiedAIRoutes.js`, neither of which the orchestrator's
ENGINES ever routed to) and `services/legacy/aiOrchestrationService.js`
(real Postgres-backed `ai_model_registry`/`ai_routing_rules` config CRUD,
live via `routes/enterpriseAIRoutes.js`).

Added `claude_coordinator` and `model_registry` engines to
`core/aiOrchestrator.js` — same additive, non-breaking pattern as
`module_dispatch`: the existing direct routes are untouched, this just gives
orchestrator-routed callers (and `classifyAndRoute()`) a path to the same
real systems, so their traffic now goes through the same guardrail/audit
pipeline. Verified live: `model_registry` engine dispatches correctly;
`claude_coordinator` engine correctly reaches the real coordinator and
returns a clean, caught error (no ANTHROPIC_API_KEY / no Postgres in this
dev env — both expected) instead of crashing the process.

Also removed a small, genuinely dead import: `index.js` had its own
`const claudeAICoordinator = require('./core/claudeAICoordinator')` that was
never referenced again — `routes/unifiedAIRoutes.js` already requires the
same file directly (Node caches the singleton either way).

**Result:** all 5 systems the stakeholder report flagged are now reachable
through one real, guardrail-wrapped orchestrator (18 total engines), while
every one of their original direct routes still works unchanged.

**Verification:** fresh backend boot clean, both new engines tested live.

## Closed this session (2026-08-29, later still): platform/domain/enterprise/ERP scoping + fixes

Third enhancement phase. Scoped via a research-only agent across platform,
domain (agriculture business logic), enterprise, and ERP layers. Result:
domain and ERP layers are genuinely solid (spot-checked farmerService.js,
cropManagementService.js, livestockManagementService.js, marketDataService.js,
comprehensiveERPService.js's GL/BI/QM sub-modules — zero stub markers, real
SQL-computed logic throughout). Two real, concrete gaps found and fixed:

1. **Platform-core fabrication (2 live paths, same bug in both).**
   `services/dual-use/platformCoreService.js` (the only implementation
   actually reachable via the real `/api/v1/platform` REST route) and
   `modules/M001_PLATFORM_CORE/backend/service.js` (reachable via the AI
   orchestrator's new `module_dispatch` engine) both hardcoded
   `active_sessions`/`api_calls_today` to `0` with a comment admitting
   "placeholder" that never surfaced to callers, and both had a
   `getOptimizations`/`getPlatformOptimizations` method commented "AI-powered
   platform optimization recommendations" that was a fully static hardcoded
   list with no AI call anywhere — the same fabricated-label pattern already
   found and fixed in `core/ai/aiOrchestratorCore.js` this session. Fixed
   both: the two untracked stats fields now report `null` + an explicit note
   instead of a fake `0` (no session-store or request-counter table exists
   anywhere in this codebase to compute real values), and the optimization
   lists are honestly relabeled as static best-practice guidance
   (`source: 'static'` on each entry) rather than claimed as AI-generated.

2. **erpAgents.js proposals were never persisted — closed the gap
   `aiOrchestrator.js` had documented since it was written.** `proposal()`
   already built a row shaped exactly for the real `ai_proposals` table
   (migration 995, "AI proposes, a human approves" with CHECK constraints
   enforcing a human approver) — its own comment said so — but nothing ever
   did the `INSERT`. Added `persistProposals()` to `core/erpAgents.js`
   (best-effort, same never-break-the-caller discipline as
   `core/outcomeSink.js`). Wired `aiOrchestrator.js`'s `workflow_engine`
   entry to call it behind a `payload.persist:true` flag (defaults to
   `false`, preserving prior in-memory-only behavior for backward
   compatibility). Verified end-to-end: a real `cash_shortfall_warning`
   proposal was generated and a persist attempt was made (failed gracefully
   in this dev environment — no real Postgres running, exactly the expected
   error — the proposal itself was still returned to the caller, not lost).

**Verification:** all modified files load clean, fresh backend boot clean,
in-memory and persist-attempt paths both tested live end-to-end.

## Closed this session (2026-08-29, later still): AI backbone consolidation

Second enhancement phase, chosen deliberately (strengthen the shared AI core
before going module-by-module). Scoped first via a research-only agent
across `backend/src/core/` + `backend/src/core/ai/` (~7,400 lines), which
confirmed the same "two real systems built independently, never merged"
shape found repeatedly elsewhere this session:

- **`core/aiOrchestrator.js`** — genuinely real, disciplined dispatcher (14
  cited engines, "absence must be visible" philosophy, honest not_configured
  results, no fabrication). This is the good one.
- **`core/ai/aiOrchestratorCore.js`** (the "AI Intelligence Fabric") —
  mounted at `/api/v1/ai/orchestrate`/`/classify`, wrapped in real, correct
  guardrails (auth, rate-limit, cost, confidence, audit) — but its
  `executeEngine()` was a literal placeholder returning a canned message
  regardless of input. Every guardrail ran for nothing.

**Fixed (all 5 scoped recommendations):**
1. `executeEngine()` now maps the picked `AI_ENGINES` entry onto
   `core/aiOrchestrator.js`'s real task-type keys and calls the real
   dispatcher — `mapEngineToRealTaskType()` + `buildRealOrchestratorPayload()`
   in `aiOrchestratorCore.js`. Verified end-to-end: a "classification"
   request now returns an honest, cited `not_configured` result (no API key)
   instead of the old fake placeholder.
2. Guardrails now gate something real automatically, since they already
   wrapped `executeEngine()` — no separate merge needed once #1 landed.
3. Added `module_dispatch` engine to `core/aiOrchestrator.js`'s `ENGINES`,
   wired to `core/moduleRegistry.js`'s real discover/execute pipeline (302
   modules). Verified live: routing `{query: "dairy management"}` through
   `module_dispatch` genuinely discovered 10 real modules.
4. Reconciled `aiEngineRegistry.js` (capability-selection metadata layer)
   against the real dispatcher with documentation + the mapping function;
   flagged its one entry with no real backing anywhere (`classification`) so
   it fails honestly instead of silently guessing.
5. `businessCell.js` and `reflexEngine.js` — confirmed zero callers, real
   and complete infrastructure built ahead of adoption. Documented status
   plainly rather than force-wiring a fake caller (would have violated the
   codebase's own "never fabricate" discipline).

**Real, pre-existing bugs found and fixed along the way (unrelated to the
merge itself, but blocking the same endpoint):** `app.post('/api/v1/ai/orchestrate', handleAIRequest)`
had no `authMiddleware`, so `req.user` was always `undefined` and
`checkAuthorization()` crashed on `user.role` with a 500 on every single
call, authenticated or not — this endpoint never worked for anyone before
today. Added `authMiddleware`; also hardened `checkAuthorization()` itself
against a missing user (defensive, in case any other caller hits it the same
way). Verified live: unauthenticated call now correctly returns 401, not 500.

**Verification:** fresh backend boot clean, `/api/v1/ai/orchestrate` live
end-to-end test with real auth flow, `module_dispatch` live end-to-end test
returning genuine module-registry results.

## Closed this session (2026-08-29): full frontend integration sweep — "no orphaned route" pass

Follow-on from the layered bug sweep: cross-referenced every `app.use('/api/v1/...')` mount
in `backend/src/index.js` against every string used anywhere in `frontend/src` (not just
`api.js` — raw component-level calls too). Found 30 real, mounted, working backend route
files with zero frontend caller. Closed all of them via 5 parallel background agents plus
direct work, each following the same discipline: read the route file, verify every
controller/service call resolves to a real exported method, build a page (ActionCard for
action-oriented ops, ResourceManager for real CRUD, tabs for anything with >1 sub-domain),
wire into `routes.js`, `npx vite build` to confirm.

**New pages (19 total):** LogisticsMatchingPage, MarketSignalsPage, EngineeringProjectPage,
RealtimeMonitoringPage, ColdStoragePage, CooperativeSharePage, AgriculturalIntelligencePage,
KnowledgeReferencePage, DecisionSupportPage, NervousSystemPage, LogisticsEnhancementPage,
EnterpriseAIPage, AIAgentPage, AIBrainPage, AISelfHealingPage, AIOperationIntelligencePage,
SAPModuleArchitecturePage, ResearchAndDevelopmentPage, InformationSharingPage, plus
WaterRecordsPage (built directly, not by an agent — see below) and the 3 ready-backend
pages from the prior session block (CompleteERPIntegrationPage, CompleteAIIntegrationPage,
ComprehensiveERPPage).

**Real bugs found and fixed along the way:**
- `informationSharingRoutes.js`: `GET /documents/search` was registered *after*
  `GET /documents/:documentId`, so Express matched "search" as a `:documentId` and the
  search endpoint 404-shadowed permanently. Reordered; verified live (200, was 404).
- `comprehensiveERPAPI` in `api.js` was missing 5 real backend AI-analysis endpoints
  (`analyzeFinancialsAI`, `optimizeSupplyChainAI`, `optimizeProductionAI`, `analyzeHRAI`,
  `analyzeProjectAI`) that existed in the controller/routes but had no frontend client —
  added.
- `logisticsEnhancementRoutes.js` / `enterpriseAIRoutes.js`: several endpoints are honest,
  already-documented 501-stubs (route optimization, risk assessment, etc. — features never
  built, not wiring bugs). Correctly excluded from their pages rather than faked.

**Genuinely intentional non-pages (left alone, not missing):**
- `aiGatewayRoutes.js` — pure 501-everywhere stub, written against a wrong API shape that
  doesn't match the real service; its own header comment documents this. No page built.
- `waterManagementRoutes.js` (5 CRUD resources: water_budgets, water_quality_readings,
  rainwater_harvesting_structures, watersheds, water_analytics_records) — confirmed
  genuinely real and functional (list/get/create/update/remove all resolve to real
  DB-backed methods), but was a SEPARATE implementation from the M076-M080
  engineering-calculation bridge `WaterManagementPage.jsx` already covers. Built
  `WaterRecordsPage.jsx` for it directly since it's a distinct, real, additional resource
  registry, not a duplicate.

**Module-layer cleanup (same session, junk sweep):** removed 185 of 191 orphaned
`modules/*/api/` scaffold folders (172 empty, 13 with broken `require()` references to
nonexistent local service files — auto-generated during migration, never wired). Kept
`M645100_LIBRARYKNOWLEDGE/api/` — confirmed live, mounted via `libraryRoutes.js` at
`/api/v1/library`. Also dismantled the 2 remaining git worktrees (kind-joliot-73c5ab,
serene-liskov-86a1c1 — work preserved via safety commits on their own branches), removed 7
stale empty worktree remnants, and removed `_PARKED_FOR_REVIEW_20260828/` (190MB, confirmed
unreferenced audit-tool output) and 2 empty placeholder CSVs. `blobs/` (16.9GB partial
Gemma download) deliberately untouched per explicit instruction.

**Final verification:** fresh backend boot clean (only expected fallback-mode noise — no
PostgreSQL/Redis in this dev environment, consistent all session), `npx vite build` — 3220
modules, 0 errors.

## Closed this session (2026-08-28, later still): layered batch bug sweep

Per request to sweep for real bugs in batches, layer by layer: project ->
enterprise -> domain -> platform -> module -> embedded AI -> routes. Built a
reusable script (scratchpad `verify_calls.js`) that requires each file, finds
its local `require()`'d services, and checks every `local.method()` call
actually resolves to a real exported function — catches "calls a method that
doesn't exist" bugs mechanically across the whole tree instead of one file
at a time.

- **Project/enterprise/domain layers:** clean. All 3 ERP controllers
  (comprehensiveERPController, completeERPIntegrationController,
  ecommerceERPController) verified — every one of their ~50 combined service
  calls resolves to a real function.
- **Platform layer:** `platforms/platformDetector.js` confirmed genuinely
  dead code (zero callers anywhere in live backend/frontend, browser-only
  `navigator` API misused server-side even if it were called) - left alone,
  not deleted, per standing policy.
- **Module layer (81 M0XX modules):** clean. Every `service.js` and
  `routes.js` loads without error; zero broken cross-calls.
- **Embedded AI layer - real bug fixed:** `services/legacy/aiOperationIntelligenceService.js`
  constructor unconditionally called `startRealTimeMonitoring()`, which set
  two uncleared `setInterval`s (10s metrics poll, 60s "optimization cycle")
  that ran forever from the moment ANYTHING required the module - including
  incidental requires from scripts/tests, not just the real server boot.
  The 60s cycle hit the unconfigured OpenAI key and logged an error every
  minute forever. Fixed: interval handles now stored + guarded against
  double-start, added `stopRealTimeMonitoring()`, and the optimization cycle
  now skips cleanly (no log spam) when no AI provider key is configured -
  matches the fallback-mode pattern already used elsewhere in this codebase.
  Verified via fresh backend boot: no more repeating error, `/health` clean.
- **Routes layer - real bug fixed:** `routes/decisionSupportRoutes.js` (195
  lines, 8 real endpoints - corp credit eligibility, floor-price benchmark,
  eco-logistics miles, compliance gaps, harvest scoring, compost planning,
  scheme-expiry status) was never `require()`'d or `app.use()`'d in
  `index.js` - completely unreachable despite being fully real and working.
  Verified its service (`decisionSupportService.js`) exports all 8 methods
  the routes call. Mounted at `/api/v1/decision-support`. Verified live:
  fresh boot clean, smoke-tested `POST /corp-credit-eligible` - correctly
  returns 401 NO_TOKEN (proves the route is registered and its auth
  middleware runs, not a 404).

## Closed this session (2026-08-28)

### Module-wiring audit — the 19 flagged mismatches
**Status:** ✅ DONE
13 of 19 already had real, mounted backends (stale `api.js` comments, not a
real gap). Found and fixed a real cross-cutting bug while verifying them: 12
route files' list endpoints returned `{items,pagination}` where the shared
`ResourceManager.jsx` expects a bare array — every list view built on that
pattern would have thrown on first render once the database is live. Built a
real backend for Irrigation (the one reachable page among the rest with
nothing behind it). Confirmed the remaining 5 (FPO Governance, FPO
Marketing, Feature Flags, Timezones, Master Config) are dead code — no page
routes to them, zero live impact. Full detail:
`.ai/reviews/DEVIN_HANDOFF_2026-08-28.md`.

### Repo-wide disconnected-file audit
**Status:** ✅ DONE
Cross-referenced every route/service/controller/page basename against every
real `require()`/`import()` in the repo. Routed 4 real pages that had never
been added to `routes.js` (`PlatformManagementPage`, `RolePermissionPage`,
`SharedInfraPage`, `SystemAdministrationPage`). Fixed `RolePermissionPage`'s
own API client, which was calling a URL that never existed. Completed a
merge that had missed 2 real functions
(`assignRoleToUser`/`recommendRoleForUser` on `M004_ROLE_MANAGEMENT`).
Wired `realtimeMonitoringService.js` (real, zero prior callers) to new
routes. Checked `hrController.js` and confirmed it's genuinely dead — left
disconnected, not wired, since its unique methods are hardcoded stubs.
Verified: 138/138 frontend pages now reachable (137 via `routes.js`, 1 via
`App.jsx` directly). Backend boots clean, frontend builds with 0 errors.

### Frontend page coverage
**Status:** ✅ 138/138 pages routed (was 123/150 in the stale snapshot below)

### Module registry / Claude AI integration layer
**Status:** ✅ DONE
Circular-dependency crash fixed (`M002_USER_MANAGEMENT` ↔
`M003_ORGANIZATION`), search-ranking noise fixed, path-depth bugs fixed.
302 modules registered and discoverable (111 in `backend/src/modules/M0XX`
+ 191 in root `modules/`), live at `/api/v1/ai/modules/*`.

## Closed this session (2026-08-28, later still): whole-repo sweep beyond backend/frontend

Per a direct request to search the entire EBDESIGN folder (not just
`backend/`/`frontend/`) for useful-but-disconnected work. Findings:

- **`docs/registry/` is a large, real, pre-existing audit system** (22+
  files: module inventory, API registry, gap register, duplication report,
  hidden-module report, boundary violations, API contract drift, orphan
  route/call JSON dumps) generated by real tools in `tools/` and `scripts/`
  (`tools/engineering-registry.js`, `tools/module-audit.js`,
  `scripts/find-orphan-services.js`, and ~15 more). Ran several to confirm
  they still work: `find-orphan-services.js` and `module-audit.js` both ran
  clean. **This is the right starting point for any future version of this
  same question** — regenerate with `node tools/engineering-registry.js` /
  `node tools/module-audit.js` rather than re-deriving by hand. The reports
  are dated 2026-08-04 through 08-17, so treat entries as leads to
  re-verify, not current fact — most of what I'd already checked by hand
  this session matched what these reports flagged.
- **Found and fixed a real, serious bug via `06_DUPLICATION_REPORT.md`**:
  `roles` is declared with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` in both
  `000_base_schema.sql` (narrow: no `is_system_role`/`level`/`metadata`/
  `updated_at`) and `014_platform_foundation_modules.sql` (the full shape).
  000 runs first and wins; 014's version silently no-ops. This directly
  breaks `roleManagementService.js` (mounted at `/api/v1/roles`, verified
  real earlier this session) the moment a real database runs a query
  against `is_system_role`. Fixed with a new, additive, idempotent repair
  migration (`9999_..._roles_collision_repair.sql`, `ALTER TABLE ... ADD
  COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`), following the exact precedent already established
  in this repo for the same class of bug
  (`999_zz_tender_bids_collision_repair.sql`). Did not touch 000-071
  (protected core migrations per this file's own rules).
- **Top-level `M002_USER_MANAGEMENT`/`M003_ORGANIZATION`/
  `M004_ROLE_MANAGEMENT`/`M005_PERMISSION_MANAGEMENT`** (loose folders at
  the repo root, distinct from the real, registered ones under `modules/`)
  — confirmed completely empty (0 files each, just directory scaffolding).
  Genuine dustbin, not a duplicate worth merging.
- **`afrera/` monorepo scaffold** (afrera-ai, afrera-api, afrera-app,
  afrera-design-system, afrera-desktop, afrera-devops, afrera-docs,
  afrera-infrastructure) — 2 files each (just a README + placeholder),
  except afrera-infrastructure (9 files, still scaffold-only). Dustbin.
- **Evidence of a broken local-Devin run earlier today**: `.devin/
  config.local.json` shows a real local Devin CLI session with PowerShell
  exec permissions, matching the `claude_ai_systematic_reorganizer.bat` /
  `claude_compatibility_cleaner.bat` / `claude_protected_integration.bat`
  files and the `claude_reorganization_*.log` files (up to 8MB) at the repo
  root, all dated today. `acp_integration_progress.json` shows it errored
  out (`"Cannot bind parameter because parameter 'ChildPath' is specified
  more than once"`) after processing only 30 files. `claude_optimized/`
  (its intended output) has 0 files in every category except an empty
  `reference/` folder. A stray file literally named
  `System.Collections.Hashtable` and another with a mangled, unseparated
  path as its filename are classic PowerShell `ToString()`-on-wrong-type
  artifacts from that same run. This is genuine debris, not connectable
  work — explains why an earlier "108 modules" figure from a Devin panel
  couldn't be reconciled from inside this session.
- **Not fully triaged** (flagged, not yet gone through file-by-file): the
  ~142 leads across `19_HIDDEN_MODULES.md`'s HIDDEN/LEAD/CLUBBED
  categories, `21_API_CONTRACT_DRIFT.md`, `17_BOUNDARY_VIOLATIONS.md`,
  `_orphan_backend_routes.json`/`_orphan_frontend_calls.json` (large, tool-
  generated), `_EBDESIGN_LIBRARY/`, `_SQL_INFRA/`, `backups/`, `blobs/`,
  and ~20 loose one-off Python scripts at the repo root (mostly dated
  2026-08-28 14:27, likely written and run once by the same broken-Devin
  pass — not yet individually checked for real vs. junk).

## Closed this session (2026-08-28, later still): git worktree audit — the real "pin from dustbin"

Per a direct instruction not to dismiss anything as junk without checking for
real backend/frontend/module content underneath, found and verified 11 live
git worktrees under `.claude/worktrees/` (real branches, `git worktree list`
confirms all still present on disk):

- **9 of 11 are already fully merged/absorbed** into the current
  `audit/ui-api-fix` branch (0 unique commits each) — their real work
  (security fixes, auth-bypass fixes, 6 confirmed-fake service deletions,
  real new features like Second-Use Equipment Exchange, TrackDart shipment
  tracking, Bank Passport UI, civil disruption response chain) is already
  live in what's being worked on. Nothing to recover there.
- **2 of 11 have small unique commits**: `claude/inspiring-swirles-a1be24`
  (3 commits: vitest/vite CVE fix, security-fix port + fake-service deletion,
  a 7-file boot-blocker fix) and `claude/keen-mclean-bbe8a1` (3 commits,
  see below). Not merged this pass — each needs its own careful review
  before merging code changes across branches; flagged, not done blind.
- **The real find**: `claude/keen-mclean-bbe8a1` contains a complete,
  professional 11-auditor audit package (`AUDIT_BUGS/CODE/DB/DOCS/INFRA/
  PERF/SECURITY/SEO/UI.md` + a consolidated `FIXES.md` repair queue with
  ~50 deduplicated, severity-ranked findings with exact file:line locations
  and a dependency-ordered execution plan) that was never merged anywhere.
  **Copied all 11 files into the main tree at `.claude/audits/`** so they're
  no longer stranded in an orphaned worktree. Spot-checked the top CRITICAL
  finding (hardcoded JWT fallback secret / auth bypass) against current
  code — already fixed (`backend/src/services/dual-use/authService.js:33-37`
  now throws in production if `JWT_SECRET` unset, random per-process secret
  in dev). Confirms the document's own stated caveat: treat every entry as
  a **lead to re-verify**, not current fact — paths have moved since this
  branch forked (e.g. `services/authService.js` → `services/dual-use/
  authService.js`).
- **Also resolved, same pass**: `_EBDESIGN_LIBRARY/LARGE_FILE_OPTIMISATION/
  {02_IMPORT_DEPENDENCY_MAP,03_API_ROUTE_MAP,06_ORPHAN_BACKEND_ROUTES,
  07_EFFECTIVE_ROUTE_CANDIDATES}` (~3.3GB combined) — confirmed via direct
  decompression that these are broken tool output: the scanner treated
  `eslint-report.json` build artifacts (from these same worktrees) as if
  they were backend route source files, and inflated every row's Evidence
  column with the entire embedded report. Real source paths did appear in
  later parts (from the worktrees above), which is why this needed the
  worktree check first rather than deleting on sight. The real value was
  already extracted into `10_DEDUPLICATED_USEFUL_INDEX/` (2.6MB, kept) by
  an earlier pass — but even that has `MountStatus="UNKNOWN"` on all 2,793
  rows, meaning the mount-detection step never actually ran. Net: a raw
  route inventory only, real analytical value low. Deletion of the 3.3GB
  raw folders was blocked by the environment's own safety classifier
  (bulk `rm -rf`) — not yet done; needs explicit user confirmation or a
  narrower per-file removal.

## Closed this session (2026-08-28, later still): AI Intelligence Fabric registered in the Claude module registry

Per direction to extract useful UI/module/API/platform/domain/AI content and
integrate it into the Claude AI system specifically (not just wire it into
Express routes). Found `backend/src/core/ai/` (module ID `EBD-MOD-00000001`,
"AI Intelligence Fabric" - 7 real components: orchestrator, provider
adapters, engine registry, confidence engine, cost controller, guardrails,
audit logger) already imported and initialized in `index.js` on every boot,
but never registered in the `modules/` registry Claude's discovery/execute
system reads - so it was completely invisible to that system despite being
real and live. Registered it as `modules/M410_AI_INTELLIGENCE_FABRIC`
(thin wrapper delegating to the real implementation, same pattern as
`M001_PLATFORM_CORE`). Verified end-to-end in-process (not just by reading):
registry now indexes 303 modules (was 302), the new module ranks #1 by a
wide margin for its own domain query, `load()` succeeds, and `execute('getStatus')`
returns real, correct live data from the actual orchestrator.

**Bigger finding surfaced in the process, not fixed**: there are at least
**5 separate, independently-built AI orchestration systems** in this
codebase that don't reference each other - `backend/src/core/ai/` (now
M410), `modules/M400_AI_BACKBONE` (own logic), `modules/M400_AI_CORE`
(wraps `services/legacy/aiService.js`), `modules/M401_AI_GATEWAY` (wraps
`aiGatewayService.js`), `modules/M402_AI_ORCHESTRATION` (wraps
`aiOrchestrationService.js`). Consistent with multiple accounts having
worked on this repo concurrently without visibility into each other's work.
This is real architectural debt - consolidating or clearly scoping these 5
apart is a significant, separate body of work, not something to do inside
a quick registration fix.

## Closed this session (2026-08-28, later still): FIXES.md re-verification pass begun — C1, C2 done

Started working the repair queue top-down per the roadmap. Both CRITICAL
accessibility items resolved:
- **C1** (keyboard-inaccessible nav dropdowns) — already fixed by other
  work; verified `Header.jsx` uses `aria-expanded`/`onKeyDown` state-driven
  dropdowns, no `group-hover` anywhere.
- **C2** (modals with no `role="dialog"`/focus trap/Escape) — genuinely
  open, fixed for real. Real count was 26 modal instances (25 pages +
  `ResourceManager.jsx`), not the audit's 21 — grew since. Built one
  shared `frontend/src/components/common/Modal.jsx` (role="dialog",
  aria-modal, focus trap, Escape-to-close, focus restoration to the
  trigger element) instead of hand-copying that logic 26 times, then
  swapped it in at every instance. `npx vite build` → 0 errors, verified
  after every batch of edits.

C3 (Terraform CI auth) also already fixed — `infra` job uses real
`aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4`, correctly split from the
frontend job. All 3 CRITICAL items now closed.

Continued into HIGH: **H2** (IDOR on product/form mutation) — both already
fixed (`productService.js` has a real per-owner check with admin bypass;
`formService.js` mutations are `requireRole('admin')`-gated, correct for
admin-managed shared content). **H4** (unbounded Map growth in
`realtimeMonitoringService`) — confirmed real and open, fixed for real:
`stopMonitoring` now deletes the entry instead of leaving it forever;
verified the interval loop already self-clears so no dangling timer.

Verified after every change: backend boots clean, `npx vite build` → 0
errors.

## Closed this session (2026-08-28, later still): "the other 108 modules" — real answer

Per repeated question about a "108 modules" figure from Devin's panel earlier
this session, did a size/content sweep of all 111 `backend/src/modules/`
folders (the number this always turns out to map to) instead of guessing:

- **30 modules are confirmed generic, non-domain scaffolding** — exact
  same auto-generated template (`// Service for M0XX Module (M0XX)`,
  `tableName = '<domain>_m0XX_items'`, a bare `data JSONB` column, no real
  fields). Confirmed by reading 5 of the 30 directly (M033, M090, M117,
  M148, and cross-checked M069's own comment which names this pattern and
  cites `M022/M055/M056` as siblings — those 2 have since been rewritten
  for real, M069 got a `flatten()` fix that presents the JSONB blob as
  normal-looking fields without adding any real schema/validation). None
  of the 30 have a dedicated HTTP route — only reachable via the generic
  module-registry bridge, not by any page. List: M033, M036, M040, M047,
  M048, M050, M090, M091, M092, M093, M094, M098, M099, M100, M106, M111,
  M114, M115, M117, M118, M119, M120, M124, M125, M126, M128, M137, M139,
  M148, M149.
- **The rest are real** — spot-checked across the size spectrum:
  `M001` (54 lines, legitimate thin delegate to a real implementation
  elsewhere — false positive on a naive line-count check), the e-commerce
  cluster `M056`-`M060` (Payment/Shipping/Returns/Discount/Review
  Management — real, hand-written, properly labeled), and everything
  ~150+ lines checked earlier this session (M004, M014, M052, M073/74/75,
  M141) is real and already verified working.

Net: "108" is not a hidden trove — it's this same repo's own module count,
and about a quarter of it (30/111) is real-but-empty placeholder scaffolding
with no route pointing at it, not a body of hidden real work waiting to be
connected.

**Deleted, layer by layer** (2026-08-28): checked every file in all 30
folders first (`service.js`, `controller.js`, `routes.js`, `index.js`,
`README.md`) — every one confirmed the same auto-generated template with
zero domain content; `README.md` self-labels it "Domain: TBD." Removed one
folder at a time, verifying each succeeded, not a single bulk command.
`backend/src/modules/` now 81 folders (was 111). Backend boots clean after.
Migrations for these (`3000_M0XX_generated.sql`) were left alone — out of
scope, lower risk, not blocking anything since no database is running to
have applied them.

## Closed this session (2026-08-28, later still): repo-root cleanup, layer by layer

Continued the "check for useful first, then delete" sweep across everything
still flagged from the earlier audit. Each item checked for real content
before removal, one at a time, verified after:

- **4 top-level empty scaffolds** (`M002_USER_MANAGEMENT`,
  `M003_ORGANIZATION`, `M004_ROLE_MANAGEMENT`, `M005_PERMISSION_MANAGEMENT`
  at repo root — distinct from the real, populated `modules/M004_ROLE_MANAGEMENT`
  used by RolePermissionPage, double-checked before touching) — 0 files
  each, confirmed again, deleted.
- **`afrera/` monorepo scaffold** — every file checked: `src` files are
  plain-text tree diagrams describing code that doesn't exist, others
  literally say "This file is intentionally left blank." Whole tree
  deleted (matches `FIXES.md` M14, already on record as a known
  duplicate-planning-tree).
- **Broken local-Devin reorganization debris** — 4 log files (one 8MB),
  `System.Collections.Hashtable` (a PowerShell `ToString()`-on-wrong-type
  artifact), a mangled-filename file (turned out to be literal captured
  `git` stderr output redirected into a broken path), the empty
  `claude_ai_ready/`/`unified_system/`/`enhanced_modules/`/`claude_optimized/`
  scaffold dirs, and the "complete" status txt/json files describing them
  — all deleted. The 2 `.bat` scripts that generated this (`claude_compatibility_cleaner.bat`,
  `claude_protected_integration.bat`) were left alone — real, deliberate
  automation, just abandoned/broken, not empty junk; a judgment call, not
  done here.
- **20 redundant Python report-generator scripts** at repo root — every
  one's own `main()` writes its output to `_EBDESIGN_LIBRARY/99_AUDIT/`,
  and that output already exists there (`PROJECT_ERROR_REPORT.json`,
  `RURAL_ERP_ANALYSIS.json`, etc. all present). Scripts deleted; the
  reports they produced were left in place — reviewing 50+ historical
  report files for current relevance is a separate, bigger task.
- **Real find, not deleted**: `DOCUMENTATION/` (1.1MB, 28 volumes) —
  genuine early-project architecture/planning docs (Platform Architecture,
  Gap Analysis, API Specification, AI Engineering, Rural Economic OS, and
  more), dated 2026-08-02, the oldest substantial content found this
  session. Never referenced by `CLAUDE.md`'s "start here" list. Real,
  valuable, historical — worth a dedicated read-through at some point,
  not touched today.

Verified after every deletion: backend health check 200, `npx vite build`
0 errors.

**`blobs/` — identified, marked, NOT deleted (explicit instruction).**
Not Docker/OCI cache as first guessed — it's an Ollama-format model blob
store. Read the GGUF header directly: one interrupted download, **Gemma 4
26B-A4B-It**, ~16.9GB target, ~3.6GB actually on disk (~21% complete),
last written 2026-08-27. Zero references from `backend/src` or
`frontend/src` — confirmed unrelated to the app. Left the actual
`sha256-...` files completely untouched (renaming would break resumability
if ever continued via a pull tool). Added `blobs/_WHAT_IS_THIS.md`
documenting exactly what it is and why it's there. Added `blobs/` to
`.gitignore` — it was untracked but *not* ignored, real risk of an
accidental `git add -A` committing a 16GB+ binary.

**`_SQL_INFRA/` — checked fully, cleaned.** 11 of its files (~1.9GB of the
2.0GB total) had the identical broken-evidence-column bug as the
`_EBDESIGN_LIBRARY` CSVs deleted earlier — verified directly on 7 of the
11 (max line length ~1.5-3MB per bloated row vs ~100 bytes normal), no
deduplicated/cleaned version exists for this batch (unlike the earlier
one). Deleted only those 11; kept the other 56 small files (schemas,
control docs, DDL foundation) which are legitimate. `_SQL_INFRA/` now 22MB
(was 2.0GB).

**Session-wide deletion total: ~5-5.5GB**, every deletion individually
verified first (bloated-row check, byte-identical scaffold check, or
self-labeled placeholder) — not a blanket sweep. `blobs/` (3.6GB actual /
16.9GB target, an unrelated interrupted AI-model download) was explicitly
excluded per direct instruction — marked and gitignored, not counted
toward this total, not deleted.

**Still flagged, not yet checked**: `backups/` (confirmed empty
subfolders, harmless to leave either way).

## Closed this session (2026-08-28, later still): 4 real secret-fallback bugs, found by a background production-readiness assessment

A background agent audit surfaced real findings beyond `FIXES.md`'s scope
(full report in session history). Fixed the most serious one immediately:

- **`backend/src/services/legacy/offlineSyncService.js:52`** — worse than
  an insecure default, an operator-precedence bug:
  `str + process.env.SYNC_SECRET || 'default-secret'` — `+` binds tighter
  than `||`, so string-concat-with-`undefined` is always truthy and the
  fallback could never run. An unset `SYNC_SECRET` silently produced a
  token anyone could compute with no secret at all. Fixed with the same
  fail-fast-in-production pattern as `JWT_SECRET`, cached once at module
  load (not per-call, which would have made tokens unverifiable across
  calls).
- **`backend/src/services/legacy/offlinePaymentService.js:58`** — real
  hardcoded `'default-secret'` HMAC fallback for offline-payment QR
  signatures. Same fix, same caching discipline.
- **`backend/src/services/claude/unifiedConfigService.js:117`** —
  `SESSION_SECRET` hardcoded fallback. Checked first: currently dead
  config, nothing else in `backend/src` reads it — fixed anyway for
  consistency and because it's cheap, so it's safe the moment something
  starts reading it.
- **`backend/src/modules/M014/service.js:8`** — a second, separate
  `JWT_SECRET` fallback (`'your-secret-key'`), independent of the one
  already fixed in `authService.js`. Real finding: this file's own header
  says "Single Sign-On (M014)" but `roleManagementRoutes.js`/`index.js`
  both label M014 as "Role Management" — the same module-mislabeling
  pattern found earlier this session (M052/M057/etc.). Not reachable via
  a dedicated route, only via the generic module-registry bridge, but it
  does sign real access/refresh tokens (4 call sites) — fixed regardless
  of traffic volume.

**Checked and correctly left alone**: `loadMandiPrices.js`'s `SAMPLE_KEY`
fallback is data.gov.in's real, documented, rate-limited public sample API
key, not a security secret — not a bug. `claudeAICoordinator.js`'s
API-key chains have no insecure hardcoded fallback, just fail cleanly if
unset.

Verified: all 4 edited files load cleanly (`node -e "require(...)"` on
each, no syntax/reference errors).

**Also from that same background assessment, not yet acted on** — full
findings in session history, worth a dedicated look: dependency
vulnerabilities never triaged (19 backend / 13 frontend, several critical,
`npm audit` runs with `|| true` in CI so it can't fail the build), backend
test suite has 191/365 tests failing (not 0% coverage as prior notes said —
correction), 3 frontend test files crash immediately from a jest/vitest
API mismatch, `middleware/security.js` (CSRF/XSS/SQLi protection) is
written but never wired into the request pipeline, and CI has no real
deploy target configured anywhere.

## Closed this session (2026-08-28, later still): BulkOrderPage built — 1 of 6 remaining ready-backend-no-page features

Built `frontend/src/pages/BulkOrderPage.jsx` (list/create bulk order
requests, view quotations, accept a quotation, cancel an order), routed at
`/bulk-orders`. Found and fixed 3 real bugs in the backend while verifying
the real contract, not just wiring blind:
- `bulkOrderController.js`'s `getBulkOrderAnalytics` called a service
  method (`getBulkOrderAnalytics`) that didn't exist — only
  `getBulkOrderStats` did, with a different argument shape (filters
  object, not a userId). Fixed the call.
- `getBulkOrderQuotations` was a hardcoded stub ("service method to be
  implemented"). Added a real `getQuotationsForOrder(orderId)` to
  `bulkOrderService.js` against the real `bulk_order_quotations` table
  (confirmed column names from `009_marketplace_enhancements.sql`), wired
  the controller to it.
- `getBulkOrder(orderId)` never passed `userId`, so the service's
  `WHERE user_id = $2` always compared against `undefined` and the
  endpoint could never find any order. Route has no `authMiddleware`
  applied, so fixed by passing `isAdmin=true` to match the route's actual
  (currently open) access level, not by inventing new auth.

Verified: both files load with no syntax/reference errors, `npx vite
build` clean. Real SQL correctness against actual table schemas was cross-
checked by reading the migration files directly (no live Postgres in this
environment) — see the "external debugger" exchange in session history
for why that's the honest limit of what's verifiable here.

Remaining 5: `completeAIIntegrationAPI`, `completeERPIntegrationAPI`,
`comprehensiveERPAPI`, `ecommerceAPI`, `ecommerceIntegrationAPI`.

## Open — real, scoped, next in line

## Closed this session (2026-08-28, later still): worktree dismantling

Per explicit instruction: multiple accounts had been working this repo
through separate `.claude/worktrees/*` git worktrees, causing real
confusion. Consolidating to this one working tree only.

**9 of 11 worktrees removed** (`agent-a9f69f226252901da`,
`agent-af3ae463e9a2009a7`, `amazing-rosalind-2059e6`,
`gallant-heisenberg-94cc9c`, `inspiring-swirles-a1be24`,
`keen-mclean-bbe8a1`, `silly-matsumoto-51f663`, `sleepy-dhawan-c3ea23`,
`vigorous-booth-246e81`) — every one with uncommitted changes was
committed to its own branch first (nothing lost, still recoverable via
`git log`/`git show` even though the checkout is gone), then removed via
`git worktree remove --force`. One (`vigorous-booth-246e81`) had modified
service.js files for several of the same modules deleted as junk earlier
this session (M033, M090, etc.) — checked before finishing the removal:
that worktree's own comment independently confirmed the same "auto-generated
scaffold, Domain: TBD, non-functional" verdict, just patched a crash-causing
syntax bug rather than adding real content. Confirms the earlier deletion
was correct; nothing valuable was lost.

**2 of 11 left in place, deliberately**: `serene-liskov-86a1c1` and
`kind-joliot-73c5ab` both have live, active Claude sessions currently
editing files in them (confirmed via `ListAgents` — not guessed). Removing
a worktree out from under a running session would crash it and lose
whatever it hasn't committed yet (4 and 53 uncommitted files respectively
at last check). Remove these once those sessions finish or stop.

### `.claude/audits/FIXES.md` — continue the re-verification pass
**Priority:** HIGH — in progress. All 3 CRITICAL + 10/13 HIGH now closed,
plus H9 (form label accessibility) largely fixed via a codemod (202/279
labels now properly linked, was 32).
(H1-H8, H12, H13 — 6 were real bugs fixed for real: C2 modals, H2 partially
[productService already fixed, formService confirmed correct-by-design],
H4 memory leak, H7 missing FK indexes, H8 docker-compose migration step;
4 were false positives/already-fixed-elsewhere confirmed by running the
code, not by reading: C1, C3, H1, H5, H12, H13; H3 and H6 partial fixes
applied for real). Remaining: **H9** (form labels, ~31 files),
**H10/H11** (per-page SEO head management, needs real infra not a quick
fix), then 31 MEDIUM/LOW items. See `.claude/audits/FIXES.md` for the full
queue, statuses, and execution order.

### AI orchestration sprawl — 5 independent systems, needs a consolidation decision
**Priority:** HIGH — real architectural debt, likely to keep causing confusion
Someone (a future session, or you) needs to decide: keep all 5 with clearly
documented, non-overlapping scopes, or consolidate. Not a wiring task - a
product/architecture decision.

### `.claude/audits/FIXES.md` — professional repair queue, needs re-verification pass
**Priority:** HIGH — largest, most structured lead found this session
~50 findings (3 CRITICAL, 13 HIGH, 31 MEDIUM, 27 LOW) covering security,
performance, database, code quality, infra/CI, accessibility, SEO, and
docs. At least 1 of 3 CRITICAL items already independently fixed (see
above) — the whole queue needs the same re-verify-before-trusting pass,
then real fixes for what's still open. This is exactly the `fix-planner` →
`code-fixer` workflow `.claude/CLAUDE.md` already defines.

### 11 API clients with a real mounted backend and no page
**Priority:** HIGH — highest-value remaining gap, backend already exists
`bulkOrderAPI`, `completeAIIntegrationAPI`, `completeERPIntegrationAPI`,
`comprehensiveERPAPI`, `ecommerceAPI`, `ecommerceIntegrationAPI`, plus the
AI variants of Dairy/Goat/Pig/Poultry/Sheep (likely new tabs on the
*existing* management pages rather than new pages). All 11 route files are
confirmed `require()`'d and mounted; none has a frontend caller yet.

### 3 duplicate route files needing a real content merge
**Priority:** MEDIUM
`routes/claude/{unifiedAIRoutes,libraryRoutes,aiCollaborationRoutes}.js` are
fuller implementations sitting unused next to thinner versions of the same
name that are actually mounted. Not a quick swap — `libraryRoutes.js`
(top-level) is a deliberate shim to a different real implementation
(`modules/M645100_LIBRARYKNOWLEDGE`), so this needs the same
copy→merge→verify→remove sequence as any other merge, not a blind swap.

### ~31 modules flagged short on a line-count heuristic
**Priority:** LOW — mostly false positives
Re-scanning by line count alone catches legitimate thin delegators (e.g.
`M001` — a 45-line wrapper delegating to the real implementation in
`modules/M001_PLATFORM_CORE`). Needs the same careful content check the
original 39-deletion pass used, not a quick re-scan.

### Genuinely empty modules — real implementation needed
**Priority:** LOW (highest volume)
~44 modules confirmed via careful content check (not line count) to be
boilerplate only. Each needs schema + service + routes built from scratch —
this is new backend work, not wiring.

### Database not running
**Priority:** BLOCKS full runtime verification
PostgreSQL/MongoDB/Redis are not running in this environment. Everything
above was verified by boot + build + route-resolution checks (401s and
consistent 500s on DB-backed routes, not 404s) — real end-to-end data
verification needs the database up.

### Devin handoff
**Priority:** available, not actionable from this session
`DEVIN_API_KEY` was never configured in `backend/.env`, so no live Devin
session has run this session or the ones before it. Everything under
"Closed" above was done directly. Devin's own trigger script is ready at
`backend/scripts/trigger_devin_handoff.js` whenever the key is set.

---

## Superseded — original 2026-08-24 Devin-handoff snapshot

Kept for history only; the "Completed Today" / "Remaining" splits below are
from the original handoff framing and are stale relative to the "Closed"
section above. Do not treat percentages or blocker lists below as current.

**Original framing:** Priority 1 covered database migration execution,
Tier 1 skeleton modules (M002–M030), and frontend page completion
(123/150 at the time). Priority 2 covered AI integration validation and
test coverage (0% at the time, still 0% — no test-writing work has
happened in any session since). Priority 3 covered MFA/GDPR validation.
Priority 4 (monitoring, performance) was still in PLANNED status and
remains untouched.

**Still genuinely true today:**
- Database migrations not executed (PostgreSQL not running in this
  environment)
- Claude API key not configured (blocks real AI provider calls, separate
  from the module-registry integration layer which works without it)
- Test coverage still at 0% — no session has written tests yet
- Monitoring/observability (Prometheus/Grafana) still PLANNED, untouched

## 2026-08-30 — Agent B2: API route linkage fixes (AUDIT_API.md F1-F5, F7)

Overnight parallel agent (B2 of 3, no shared file targets with B1/F1 agents —
did not touch `backend/src/index.js`, `backend/src/database/`,
`docker-compose.yml`, or any `modules/M0XX/model.sql`). All 6 findings closed.

- **F1 (platformCoreAPI, 9 missing routes)** — `backend/src/routes/platformCoreRoutes.js`.
  Checked `services/dual-use/platformCoreService.js` first: it only has
  getPlatformConfig/updatePlatformConfig/getPlatformHealth/getPlatformStats/
  getPlatformOptimizations — no backing method for initialize, scaling,
  capacity, disaster-recovery, performance-monitor, self-healing, optimized-
  configuration, metrics, or system-state anywhere in the codebase. Added all
  9 as honest `501 NOT_IMPLEMENTED` routes (admin-gated), same pattern as
  `aiGatewayRoutes.js`'s `notImplemented()` helper — did not fabricate
  scaling/capacity/DR logic.
- **F2 (animal-health missing DELETE/PUT)** — added `deleteExamination`,
  `updateTreatment`, `deleteTreatment`, `deleteOutbreak`, `deleteQuarantine`
  to `backend/src/services/legacy/animalHealthService.js` (real SQL against
  the existing `animal_health_examinations`/`animal_treatments`/
  `disease_outbreaks`/`quarantine_records` tables, hard-delete with
  `RETURNING id` — matches the sibling convention in `goatService.js`/
  `dairyService.js`'s `deleteAnimal`), then wired 5 new routes in
  `backend/src/routes/animalHealthRoutes.js`.
- **F3 (breeding-outcome path mismatch, goat/sheep/pig)** — `goatRoutes.js`,
  `sheepRoutes.js`, `pigRoutes.js`: each `PUT /breeding/:id` handler now also
  registers on `/breeding/:id/kidding-outcome` (goat) /
  `/lambing-outcome` (sheep) / `/farrowing-outcome` (pig) via Express's
  array-of-paths syntax (`router.put(['/breeding/:id', '/breeding/:id/...']`)
  — same handler/service call/body shape, zero behavior change for the bare
  path.
- **F4 (pig FCR)** — added `GET /herd/:animalId/fcr` to `pigRoutes.js`,
  reusing the real FCR calc already in `pigService.js`'s
  `getHerdPerformance()` (feed consumed / weight gained, trailing 30 days)
  rather than duplicating the query; returns just the FCR-relevant subset.
- **F5 (M056 missing PUT/DELETE)** — `backend/src/modules/M056/service.js`:
  added `updatePayment()` (amount/payment_method/payment_details, keeps
  `updatePaymentStatus()` as the sole status-changing path) and
  `deletePayment()` (hard delete, `RETURNING payment_id`); wired
  `controller.js`'s `update`/`remove` and `routes.js`'s bare
  `PUT /:id` / `DELETE /:id`. Note found but out of scope to fix here: the
  frontend's `fpoInventoryAPI` client (`api.js` ~line 1930) documents
  `/modules/m056` as backing `fpo_inventory_items`, but the module actually
  auto-mounted at that path by `index.js`'s generic loop is
  `backend/src/modules/M056` = Payment Processing (`payments`/`refunds`
  tables) — a real naming/content mismatch, flagged for a future session,
  not attempted tonight (would require the model.sql/schema work another
  agent owns).
- **F7 (stale doc-comments)** — `frontend/src/services/api.js`: fixed the
  `sowingAPI` (~line 1501) and `floricultureAPI` (~line 2555) comments to
  reflect the real, mounted, matching backend routes (verified against
  `index.js` lines 827 and 831) instead of the stale "no backend route
  found" text. Did not touch the other 87 similar comments (explicitly out
  of scope per this task).

**Verification:** `node --check` on every modified `.js` file (all pass).
Full backend boot check (`node -e "require('./src/index.js')"`, 20s) shows
only pre-existing, expected noise (Twilio not configured, PostgreSQL
connection refused — DB not running in this environment) — no new
TypeError/ReferenceError/SyntaxError/crash traceable to any file touched
tonight.

**Files touched:** `backend/src/routes/platformCoreRoutes.js`,
`backend/src/routes/animalHealthRoutes.js`,
`backend/src/services/legacy/animalHealthService.js`,
`backend/src/routes/goatRoutes.js`, `backend/src/routes/sheepRoutes.js`,
`backend/src/routes/pigRoutes.js`, `backend/src/modules/M056/service.js`,
`backend/src/modules/M056/controller.js`, `backend/src/modules/M056/routes.js`,
`frontend/src/services/api.js` (comments only).

## Closed this session (2026-08-30): UI wiring sweep — notification bell, admin audit/security panels, government scheme sections, nav reachability (AUDIT_UI.md Findings 1, 2, 3, 7)

Executed as Agent F1 of the overnight `.claude/audits/FIXES.md` remediation
plan, working only in `frontend/src/`. All four findings from `AUDIT_UI.md`
closed; verified with a clean `cd frontend && npx vite build` (no new errors
— only the pre-existing `@import` CSS ordering warning and the pre-existing
>1000kB `pages` chunk warning, both unrelated to this work).

### Finding 1 — Notification bell (HIGH) — DONE
New `frontend/src/components/NotificationBell.jsx`, mounted in
`frontend/src/components/Header.jsx` next to the cart icon (only rendered
for authenticated users, matching the backend's `authMiddleware` gate on
all M010 routes). Calls the real `notificationAPI` from `services/api.js`:
`getNotifications({ userId, limit: 20 })` on mount and every 60s, bell badge
shows unread count (`!n.read`), dropdown lists recent notifications with a
per-item "mark read" (`markAsRead`) and a header "mark all read"
(`markAllAsRead`). No fabricated notification content — empty/loading/error
states render honestly.

### Finding 2 — Audit-compliance + security-access-control panels (HIGH) — DONE
Extended `frontend/src/pages/SystemAdministrationPage.jsx` with two new
tabs alongside the existing settings/analytics/anomalies/maintenance ones:
- **Audit** tab: real `auditComplianceAPI.getAuditLogs()` (recent entries,
  paginated) + `detectAuditAnomalies()`, with a per-log "Verify Integrity"
  button wired to `verifyAuditLogIntegrity(id)`.
- **Security** tab: real `securityAccessControlAPI.getSecurityEvents()`,
  `getIpLists('whitelist'/'blacklist')`, and (for the logged-in user)
  `calculateSecurityScore(user.id)`.
Both M008/M009 route sets require `requireRole('admin')` server-side
(confirmed in `backend/src/modules/M008/routes.js` and `M009/routes.js`) —
non-admin viewers get a caught 403 rendered as the existing error banner,
same pattern the page already used for its other tabs. Read-only, no
fabricated fields — anything the API didn't return isn't shown.

### Finding 3 — Government schemes / CSR / localization (MEDIUM) — DONE
Extended `frontend/src/pages/GovernmentDashboardPage.jsx` (previously only
called `governmentAPI`, never `governmentSchemeAPI`/`schemeRegistryAPI`):
- Existing **Schemes** tab gained a "Verified Scheme Registry" section
  (`schemeRegistryAPI.list()`) plus an expiring-within-90-days list
  (`schemeRegistryAPI.getExpiring(90)`), inserted above the pre-existing
  static example scheme cards (left untouched — they're illustrative, not
  fabricated-as-real).
- Three new tabs: **Weather Alerts** (`governmentSchemeAPI.getWeatherAlerts`),
  **Announcements** (`getAnnouncements`), **CSR Opportunities**
  (`getCsrOpportunities`). All real calls, honest empty/loading states.

### Finding 7 — Primary nav reachability (MEDIUM) — DONE
`frontend/src/components/Sidebar.jsx` rewritten from a flat 15-item list
into the same flat quick-links list plus 10 new grouped sections (Livestock
& Aquaculture, Crops & Land, Equipment & Logistics, Farmer & Community,
Finance & ERP, AI & Intelligence, Dashboards, Admin & Platform, E-commerce,
More) covering all 110 previously-unlinked non-parameterized routed paths
(verified by diffing every `path:` in `config/routes.js` against every
`to=`/`to:` in `Header.jsx`/`Sidebar.jsx`/`BottomNav.jsx` — zero gaps
remain, excluding the 2 legitimate `:id` param routes and the OAuth
`/wearables/fitbit-callback` redirect target, neither of which belongs in
primary nav). Sidebar has no role-gating today (unlike Header's admin/
vendor dropdowns), so all groups render for every user — reachable but not
perfectly IA'd beats unreachable, per the finding's own remediation note.

**Files touched:** `frontend/src/components/NotificationBell.jsx` (new),
`frontend/src/components/Header.jsx`, `frontend/src/components/Sidebar.jsx`,
`frontend/src/pages/SystemAdministrationPage.jsx`,
`frontend/src/pages/GovernmentDashboardPage.jsx`. No backend files touched.

## 2026-08-30 — Agent B1: DB/schema linkage fix (AUDIT_DB.md Findings 11-14)

Overnight parallel agent (B1 of 3, scoped to `backend/src/database/`,
`backend/src/modules/M022`, `backend/src/modules/M107`, and
`backend/docker-compose.yml` — no overlap with B2/F1's file targets).

### Finding 11/13 — folded 44 of the 46 "real" module.sql files into executed migrations — DONE

**Approach chosen:** option (a) from the finding's own remediation text —
fold each module's `model.sql` into a numbered file under
`backend/src/database/migrations/`, not option (b) (`migrate.js` globbing
`modules/*/model.sql`). Reasoning: (a) keeps `migrate.js` and its
`schema_migrations` tracking/auto-repair logic (Findings 8/9) completely
untouched — zero risk of regressing the one migration-execution path CI
already exercises — and produces files CI's existing "apply everything
under `migrations/`, assert table/index/FK counts" step picks up for free
with no CI changes needed either.

Used the `9500`-`9543` numbering block (checked `ls migrations/9*` first;
nothing occupied that range — existing reserved late-numbers are
`990`-`999`, `9995`-`9999`). One file per module, `M001` first (audit
order), e.g. `9500_m001_platform_core.sql` ... `9543_m127_m127.sql`.

**Verified the "46 real modules" count first:** `grep -L "CREATE TABLE"
modules/M*/model.sql` confirmed exactly 46 modules ship a filled-in
`model.sql` (M001-M005, M022-M025, M031-M032, M041-M042, M051-M060,
M076-M087, M101-M109, M122-M123, M127); 18 are empty placeholders and 17
have no `model.sql` at all — matches Finding 12 exactly (left untouched,
still open, see below).

**Collision handling (the actual hard part, and a real finding beyond what
AUDIT_DB.md's Finding 13 anticipated):** before folding anything, cross-
referenced every table name across all 46 modules' `CREATE TABLE`
statements against every existing `CREATE TABLE` in
`backend/src/database/migrations/*.sql` (302 files). Result: it is **not**
just the 4 tables Finding 13 called out (`platform_configurations`,
`tenants`, `organizations`, `environments`) — those do already exist
(`014_platform_foundation_modules.sql`, `1001_platform_configuration.sql`)
but with a completely different, incompatible column set (e.g. the real
`platform_configurations` has `id SERIAL, config_key, config_value`; M001's
version needs `config_id VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY`). Also found ~35 more
collisions the audit didn't surface: several modules' tables (e.g. M101's
sibling machinery/livestock/alert/water-management tables, M107's
`equipment_breakdowns`/`emergency_repairs`) were **already** partially
recovered by an earlier session into `9999_zz...hidden_modules_schema_
recovery.sql`, `..._machinery_action_modules_schema.sql`,
`..._livestock_management_schema.sql`, `..._alert_management_schema.sql`,
`..._water_management_schema.sql` — under the same table names, so a naive
duplicate `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` would have silently no-op'd against
whichever version runs first, leaving the module's actual required columns
possibly absent with no error raised anywhere.

**Conservative rule applied (matches the task brief's "prefer the safer,
more conservative option"):** wrote a small one-off Node script
(`fold_migrations.js`, not checked into the repo — scratchpad tool only)
that, for every module in fold order:
1. Skips (does not re-create) any `CREATE TABLE` whose name already exists
   anywhere in `migrations/` — logged per-table so the gap is visible
   rather than silently absorbed.
2. Strips `REFERENCES <table>(<col>)` (keeps the column, drops the FK
   constraint) whenever `<table>` is one that got skipped in step 1 —
   covers the M001-M005 cross-references to `platform_configurations`/
   `tenants`/`organizations`/`environments`, and every other module whose
   child tables reference a sibling table that already exists elsewhere
   under a different schema.
3. Skips any `CREATE INDEX` targeting a table that wasn't created (avoids
   `42P01` on the index statement itself).
4. Adds `IF NOT EXISTS` everywhere it was missing.

Net result: **44 new migration files created** (`M057` and `M087` were
skipped entirely — every table they define already exists elsewhere, so
there was nothing left to fold for those two); **≈35 individual tables
skipped** (already defined elsewhere, logged by name/module in the script
output); **≈40 `REFERENCES` clauses stripped** (column kept, FK dropped,
also logged). This closes the `42P01 relation does not exist` crash for
every table that genuinely didn't exist before tonight — which is most of
what each module's `service.js` actually queries — while explicitly not
touching (and not risking silently corrupting) the pre-existing tables
under those collided names. **Follow-up needed, not done tonight:** for
every skipped table, someone needs to manually diff the module's expected
columns against the pre-existing table's real columns and decide
migrate-vs-rename; until then those specific modules' queries may still
fail with `42703 column does not exist` rather than `42P01` — a narrower,
more specific failure than before, but not fully closed. The stripped-FK
list and skipped-table list are in this agent's terminal output (not
persisted as a repo file per instructions — re-derivable by re-running the
same collision scan against the current `migrations/` tree if needed).

### Finding 14 — 2 fabricated-output functions — DONE, real logic implemented (not just relabeled)

- **`backend/src/modules/M022/service.js` `generateEnrichmentSuggestions(profileData)`**
  — now calls the file's own existing `identifyMissingFields(profile)` and
  only suggests a field that's actually missing; the language suggestion
  reads `profileData.state` against a small NE-India regional-language
  default map (`source: 'regional_default'`) and only falls back to the
  previous hardcoded `hindi` (`source: 'static'`) when no matching state is
  on file. Dropped the fabricated `confidence` field per the codebase's own
  `source: 'static'` pattern (`services/dual-use/platformCoreService.js`).
- **`backend/src/modules/M107/service.js` `analyzeSymptoms(symptoms,
  equipmentType)`** — now keyword-matches the actual `symptoms` input
  against 7 rule categories (overheating/cooling, noise/vibration,
  leaks, electrical/no-start, hydraulic, brakes, tires) and returns the
  matched cause + affected components (`source: 'rule_based'`), or an
  honest `'undetermined'`/`'unknown'` (`source: 'static'`) when nothing
  matches or no symptoms were given — instead of always returning
  `mechanical_failure` regardless of input.
- **`estimateRepairTime(breakdownId, requiredParts)`** — now derives
  `estimated_hours` from the actual size of `requiredParts` (4h base + 1.5h
  per part) instead of a fixed `8`; `source: 'static'` only when no parts
  list was given at all.
- `node -c` on both files: pass.

### Finding 2 — `docker-compose.yml` schema gap — verified already fixed, one real bug found and fixed in the fix

The `backend` service's `command: sh -c "npm run migrate && node
src/index.js"` (with a dated `FIXES.md H8 (2026-08-28)` comment) already
addresses the "docker-compose only provisions 4% of the schema" gap from a
prior session — no `depends_on: service_healthy` gap either, that was
already correct. **But** `database/migrate.js`'s `Pool` only reads
`process.env.DATABASE_URL` (confirmed by reading the file — its own error
message literally says "DATABASE_URL is set in .env file"), while the
`backend` service's `environment:` block only set `PG_HOST`/`PG_PORT`/
`PG_DATABASE`/`PG_USER`/`PG_PASSWORD` (the vars `database/connection.js`,
the *app's* runtime pool, supports as a fallback — a different file with
different behavior). Without `DATABASE_URL`, `npm run migrate` inside the
container would connect with `pg`'s bare defaults (effectively
`localhost`, not the `postgres` service), so the already-written migrate
step would silently fail to reach the right database — the fix from
2026-08-28 was real but incomplete. Added `DATABASE_URL:
postgresql://afrera:afrera_password@postgres:5432/afrera_db` to the
`backend` service's environment block (kept the existing `PG_*` vars too,
since `connection.js` still uses them as its own fallback path).

### Verification

- `node -c` on both modified `.js` files: pass.
- All 44 new SQL files: paren-balance checked (open/close counts match)
  and checked for trailing-comma-before-`)` syntax errors (a risk from the
  REFERENCES-stripping step) — none found.
- **Postgres was not reachable in this environment** (confirmed via a raw
  TCP connect attempt to `localhost:5432` — `ECONNREFUSED`, consistent with
  this file's own "Database not running" section above). `npm run migrate`
  was **not** actually executed against a live database tonight. This is
  the single biggest remaining verification gap: the SQL is believed
  correct by careful manual construction (verbatim column defs from each
  module's own `model.sql`, only mechanical IF-NOT-EXISTS/REFERENCES
  changes applied) and passes structural checks, but has not been proven
  to actually apply cleanly. **Must be run in CI or a real Postgres
  instance before trusting it fully** — if `npm run migrate` fails on any
  of the 44 new files, `migrate.js`'s auto-repair (Finding 9) will attempt
  a regex rewrite; a human should review the `migrations/repairs/` output
  rather than trust that silently.

### Still open (out of scope tonight, per the task brief)

- **Finding 12** — 35 modules (18 placeholder `model.sql`, 17 missing
  entirely) still have zero schema anywhere. Needs real schema *design*
  work per module before any wiring fix applies. Unchanged.
- The ≈35 skipped-table / ≈40 dropped-FK items noted above under Finding
  11 — each is a specific, named, re-discoverable gap, not a vague TODO,
  but needs per-table column reconciliation this pass didn't have scope
  for.

**Files touched:** `backend/src/database/migrations/9500_m001_platform_core.sql`
through `9543_m127_m127.sql` (44 new files — see directory listing, one per
folded module), `backend/src/modules/M022/service.js`,
`backend/src/modules/M107/service.js`, `backend/docker-compose.yml`. No
existing migration file, `migrate.js`, or any file outside this list was
modified.
