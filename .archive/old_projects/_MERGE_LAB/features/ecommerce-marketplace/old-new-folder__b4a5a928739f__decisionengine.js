/**
 * Decision Engine — cross-module correlation and response.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * AFRERA had 62 services that each made local decisions well and had no way to
 * make a joint one. A cold-chain temperature breach was an IoT event; the fact
 * that the same shipment carried a high-value insured consignment for a
 * first-time buyer lived in three other modules and was never brought
 * together. This engine is where those facts meet.
 *
 * In the platform's body analogy: signalBus is the nervous system, this is the
 * brain. Two distinct response paths, matching real physiology:
 *
 *   REFLEX  — a single signal above a severity threshold triggers an immediate,
 *             pre-wired response. No deliberation. (Spinal reflex arc.)
 *   REASONED — several signals across different modules, correlated over a time
 *             window, produce a judged decision with an explanation.
 *
 * Every decision carries the signals that caused it and a human-readable
 * rationale. A decision that cannot be explained cannot be trusted, audited, or
 * appealed — and several of these decisions affect a farmer's money.
 *
 * The engine NEVER executes side effects itself. It emits a decision; effectors
 * subscribe and act. That keeps it testable and prevents the brain from
 * reaching directly into an organ.
