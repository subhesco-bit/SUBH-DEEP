/**
 * Civil Disruption / Blockade Response Chain.
 *
 * Backs migration 9999_zzzzz_civil_disruption_schema.sql. Confirmed
 * genuinely absent before building (2026-08-15) — a real, recurring
 * operational reality in Northeast India (economic blockades on national
 * highways, bandhs/strikes) that this platform had no way to record or
 * react to.
 *
 * MATCHING HONESTY: affected-shipment matching is a free-text ILIKE
 * against shipments.origin_address/destination_address for the
 * disruption's state/district/route names — not GPS routing. This
 * codebase's geospatial layer is deliberately incremental (see
 * 997_geospatial_indexes.sql's decision block), so this is a real,
 * approximate signal, never presented as precise geofencing.
