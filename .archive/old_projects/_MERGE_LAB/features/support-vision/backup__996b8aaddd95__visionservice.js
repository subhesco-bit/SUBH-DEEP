/**
 * Vision Service — real, offline image analysis via `sharp`.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE (2026-08-09 follow-up to the aiOrchestrator audit)
 *
 * `sharp` has been a backend/package.json dependency (^0.33.1) with ZERO
 * `require('sharp')` call sites anywhere in backend/src — a dead dependency
 * (see core/aiOrchestrator.js's vision_engine citation, pre-this-change).
 * This file is the first real usage.
 *
 * GROUNDING — real AFRERA use case, not built in a vacuum:
 * `database/migrations/000_base_schema.sql` line ~161: `products.images
 * JSONB DEFAULT '[]'` — every GI-tagged product listing already has a slot
 * for photos, but nothing in backend/src ever validates or processes an
 * uploaded image before it lands there. `analyzeImageQuality()` is meant to
 * gate a farmer/vendor photo upload (blurry or near-black photos are a real,
 * common problem with field-uploaded produce photos) before it is accepted
 * into `products.images`; `generateThumbnail()` is meant to produce the
 * listing-thumbnail variant instead of shipping the full-resolution upload
 * to every storefront request. `user_profiles.profile_image_url TEXT`
 * (same migration, line ~63) is the analogous single-image case (profile
 * photo) these functions equally serve.
 *
 * HONESTY NOTE ON QUALITY
 * `analyzeImageQuality()` uses sharp's own documented `.stats()` output —
 * `sharpness` ("estimation of greyscale sharpness based on the standard
 * deviation of a Laplacian convolution") and per-channel `mean` brightness.
 * This is a real, but simple, statistical heuristic — NOT a deep-learning
 * quality classifier, and sharp's own docs mark `sharpness`/`entropy` as
 * "experimental". Do not present its verdict as a certified quality score;
 * it is a coarse, explainable pre-filter (catches obviously unusable
 * photos), not a substitute for human review of a compliance-relevant image.
