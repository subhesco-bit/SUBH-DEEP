/**
 * Autonomous outcome resolution + calibration gates.
 *
 * THE CORRECTION THIS FILE MAKES
 *
 * The first version of the learning loop required a named human to judge every
 * outcome. That was over-cautious and it kept the loop shut. Most of what this
 * platform predicts is objectively resolvable from data it already stores — a
 * demand forecast against actual sales, an ETA against the delivery timestamp,
 * a batch quarantine against the lab result that lands three days later. Making
 * a person confirm arithmetic the database can do is not safety, it is a
 * bottleneck wearing safety's clothes.
 *
 * So: fully autonomous wherever ground truth exists. `ai_resolution_rules`
 * declares where the truth for each prediction type lives, and this module goes
 * and gets it. No human, no queue, no waiting.
 *
 * WHERE AUTONOMY GENUINELY STOPS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A LIMIT OF THE AI
 *
 * One class resists automation and it is not a modelling problem. When the
 * system BLOCKS something — quarantines a batch, holds a transaction, reroutes
 * a truck — the blocked thing never happens, so its consequence is never
 * observed. There is one timeline. No model, however good, can measure an
 * outcome that was prevented from occurring.
 *
 * The honest engineering answer is not to pretend otherwise. It is to score
 * those on a declared proxy at reduced weight, and to record the reduced
 * weight rather than launder a guess into a fact. A fraud model that grades
 * itself on transactions it blocked will report excellent accuracy forever
 * while learning nothing; that is a self-confirming loop, and it fails silently.
 * The weighting is what keeps it honest.
 *
 * The comparison to autonomous weapons cuts the same way. Those systems close
 * their loop because a hit is directly observable. Where their outcome is NOT
 * observable — whether the target was correctly identified — is precisely
 * where they are hardest to validate and most contested. The lesson is not
 * "remove the human because weapons did"; it is "automate everything the world
 * will tell you the answer to, and be explicit about the rest."
 *
 * Here that means roughly seven of eight prediction types run with no human at
 * all. One does not, and says so.
